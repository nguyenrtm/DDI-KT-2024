7 DRUG INTERACTIONS As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): ( 2.9 , 2.10 , 4.1 , 5.2 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 enzyme pathway ( 7.7 ) Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Monitor TCA levels during coadministration with PROZAC or when PROZAC has been recently discontinued ( 5.2 , 7.7 ) CNS Acting Drugs: Caution should be used when taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs ( 7.2 ) Benzodiazepines: Diazepam – increased t½, alprazolam - further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased levels ( 7.7 ) Antipsychotics: Potential for elevation of haloperidol and clozapine levels ( 7.7 ) Anticonvulsants: Potential for elevated phenytoin and carbamazepine levels and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity ( 7.7 ) Serotonergic Drugs: ( 2.9 , 2.10 , 4.1 , 5.2 ) Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin): May potentiate the risk of bleeding ( 7.4 ) Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins : May cause a shift in plasma concentrations ( 7.6 , 7.7 ) Olanzapine : When used in combination with PROZAC, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax ( 7.7 ) Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval: Do not use Prozac with thioridazine or pimozide. Use with caution in combination with other drugs that prolong the QT interval ( 4.2 , 5.11 , 7.7 , 7.8 ) 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) [See Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 , 2.10 ), Contraindications ( 4.1 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.2 CNS Acting Drugs Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of PROZAC and such drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs [See Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 , 2.10 ), Contraindications ( 4.1 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDS, Aspirin, Warfarin) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 7.5 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies establishing the benefit of the combined use of ECT and fluoxetine. There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment. 7.6 Potential for Other Drugs to affect PROZAC Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins — Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma proteins, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound fluoxetine by other tightly-bound drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.7 Potential for PROZAC to affect Other Drugs Pimozide — Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval. Fluoxetine can increase the level of pimozide through inhibition of CYP2D6. Fluoxetine can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QT prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and PROZAC [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7.8 )] . Thioridazine — Thioridazine should not be administered with PROZAC or within a minimum of 5 weeks after PROZAC has been discontinued, because of the risk of QT Prolongation [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7.8 )] . In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C max and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsades de Pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. This risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 — Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4.2 )] . Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) — In 2 studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased greater than 2- to 10-fold when fluoxetine has been administered in combination. This influence may persist for 3 weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. Thus, the dose of TCAs may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Benzodiazepines — The half-life of concurrently administered diazepam may be prolonged in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels. Antipsychotics — Some clinical data suggests a possible pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics. Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine. Anticonvulsants — Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment. Lithium — There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported. Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins — Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma proteins, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4 — In an in vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Olanzapine — Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using PROZAC and olanzapine and in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax.  7.8 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval Do not use PROZAC in combination with thioridazine or pimozide. Use PROZAC with caution in combination with other drugs that cause QT prolongation. These include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). PROZAC is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the concentration of PROZAC. Concomitant use of other highly protein-bound drugs can increase the concentration of PROZAC [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although the exact mechanism of PROZAC is unknown, it is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and α 1 -adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in vitro than do the tricyclic drugs. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic Bioavailability — In man, following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 hours. The Pulvule and PROZAC Weekly capsule dosage forms of fluoxetine are bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with or without food. PROZAC Weekly capsules, a delayed-release formulation, contain enteric-coated pellets that resist dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. The enteric coating delays the onset of absorption of fluoxetine 1 to 2 hours relative to the immediate-release formulations. Protein Binding — Over the concentration range from 200 to 1000 ng/mL, approximately 94.5% of fluoxetine is bound in vitro to human serum proteins, including albumin and α 1 -glycoprotein. The interaction between fluoxetine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but may be important. Enantiomers — Fluoxetine is a racemic mixture (50/50) of R -fluoxetine and S -fluoxetine enantiomers. In animal models, both enantiomers are specific and potent serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially equivalent pharmacologic activity. The S -fluoxetine enantiomer is eliminated more slowly and is the predominant enantiomer present in plasma at steady state. Metabolism — Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine. In animal models, S -norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to R - or S -fluoxetine. R -norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney. Variability in Metabolism — A subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S -fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of S -fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of S -norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of R -fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4 active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine achieves a steady-state concentration rather than increasing without limit. Because fluoxetine's metabolism, like that of a number of other compounds including TCAs and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )] . Accumulation and Slow Elimination — The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose. Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks. The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of PROZAC. Weekly Dosing — Administration of PROZAC Weekly once weekly results in increased fluctuation between peak and trough concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine compared with once-daily dosing [for fluoxetine: 24% (daily) to 164% (weekly) and for norfluoxetine: 17% (daily) to 43% (weekly)]. Plasma concentrations may not necessarily be predictive of clinical response. Peak concentrations from once-weekly doses of PROZAC Weekly capsules of fluoxetine are in the range of the average concentration for 20 mg once-daily dosing. Average trough concentrations are 76% lower for fluoxetine and 47% lower for norfluoxetine than the concentrations maintained by 20 mg once-daily dosing. Average steady-state concentrations of either once-daily or once-weekly dosing are in relative proportion to the total dose administered. Average steady-state fluoxetine concentrations are approximately 50% lower following the once-weekly regimen compared with the once-daily regimen. C max for fluoxetine following the 90 mg dose was approximately 1.7-fold higher than the C max     value for the established 20 mg once-daily regimen following transition the next day to the once-weekly regimen. In contrast, when the first 90 mg once-weekly dose and the last 20 mg once-daily dose were separated by 1 week, C max     values were similar. Also, there was a transient increase in the average steady-state concentrations of fluoxetine observed following transition the next day to the once-weekly regimen. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, it may be better to separate the first 90 mg weekly dose and the last 20 mg once-daily dose by 1 week [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 12.4 Specific Populations Liver Disease — As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Disease — In depressed patients on dialysis (N=12), fluoxetine administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function. While the possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired patients. Geriatric Pharmacokinetics — The disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly subjects (&gt;65 years of age) did not differ significantly from that in younger normal subjects. However, given the long half-life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not adequate to rule out the possibility of altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they have systemic illness or are receiving multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in 260 elderly but otherwise healthy depressed patients (≥60 years of age) who received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Combined fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were 209.3 ± 85.7 ng/mL at the end of 6 weeks. No unusual age-associated pattern of adverse reactions was observed in those elderly patients. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics (children and adolescents) — Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 21 pediatric patients (10 children ages 6 to &lt;13, 11 adolescents ages 13 to &lt;18) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Fluoxetine 20 mg/day was administered for up to 62 days. The average steady-state concentrations of fluoxetine in these children were 2-fold higher than in adolescents (171 and 86 ng/mL, respectively). The average norfluoxetine steady-state concentrations in these children were 1.5-fold higher than in adolescents (195 and 113 ng/mL, respectively). These differences can be almost entirely explained by differences in weight. No gender-associated difference in fluoxetine pharmacokinetics was observed. Similar ranges of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were observed in another study in 94 pediatric patients (ages 8 to &lt;18) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Higher average steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were observed in children relative to adults; however, these concentrations were within the range of concentrations observed in the adult population. As in adults, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine accumulated extensively following multiple oral dosing; steady-state concentrations were achieved within 3 to 4 weeks of daily dosing.</Section>

<SentenceText>Metabolism — Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3794" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="3796" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>R-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3797" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3798" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Variability in Metabolism — A subset (about7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P4502D6(CYP2D6).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3799" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Such individuals are referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3800" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S-fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of S-fluoxetine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3801" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Consequently, concentrations of S-norfluoxetine at steady state were lower.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3802" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The metabolism of R-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3803" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3804" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3805" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3806" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>This explains how fluoxetine achieves a steady-state concentration rather than increasing without limit.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3807" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Because fluoxetine's metabolism, like that of a number of other compounds including TCAs and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="3808" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Accumulation and Slow Elimination — The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1to 3days after acute administration and 4to 6days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4to 16days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3809" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>After 30days of dosing at 40mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91to 302ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72to 258ng/mL have been observed.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3810" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because fluoxetine's metabolism is not proportional to dose.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3811" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3812" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6days and after multiple dosing was 9.3days.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3813" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4to 5weeks.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3814" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3815" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of PROZAC.</SentenceText>

</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3822" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Cmax for fluoxetine following the 90 mg dose was approximately 1.7-fold higher than the Cmax value for the established 20 mg once-daily regimen following transition the next day to the once-weekly regimen.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3823" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In contrast, when the first90 mgonce-weekly dose and the last 20 mgonce-daily dose were separated by 1week, Cmax values were similar.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3824" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Also, there was a transient increase in the average steady-state concentrations of fluoxetine observed following transition the next day to the once-weekly regimen.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3825" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>From a pharmacokinetic perspective, it may be better to separate the first90 mgweekly dose and the last 20 mgonce-daily dose by 1week.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="3826" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Liver Disease — As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3827" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6days compared with the range of 2to 3days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7to 9days in normal subjects.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3828" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3829" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="3830" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Renal Disease — In depressed patients on dialysis(N=12), fluoxetine administered as 20mg once daily for 2months produced steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3831" LabelDrug="Prozac" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>While the possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired patients.</SentenceText>
