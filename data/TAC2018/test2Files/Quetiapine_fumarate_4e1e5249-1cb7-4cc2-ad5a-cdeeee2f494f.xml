7. DRUG INTERACTIONS  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Reduce quetiapine dose to one sixth when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) ( 2.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers: Increase quetiapine dose up to 5 fold when used in combination with a chronic treatment (more than 7 to 14 days) of potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) ( 2.6 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers: Reduce quetiapine dose by 5 fold within 7 to 14 days of discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers ( 2.6 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine  The risks of using quetiapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.  Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e..g, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.  CYP3A4 inhibitors: Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  CYP3A4 inducers: Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold. Increased doses of quetiapine up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ].  The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs  Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, quetiapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.  Quetiapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.  There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of quetiapine on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Quetiapine and its metabolites are non-inhibitors of major metabolizing CYP’s (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  The mechanism of action of quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of quetiapine in schizophrenia and its mood stabilizing properties in bipolar depression and mania are mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D 2 ) and serotonin type 2 (5HT 2 ) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT 2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other effects of quetiapine.  Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug.  Quetiapine's antagonism of adrenergic α 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT 1A and 5HT 2 (IC 50s =717 &amp; 148nM, respectively), dopamine D 1 and D 2 (IC 50s =1268 &amp; 329nM, respectively), histamine H 1 (IC50=30nM), and adrenergic α1 and α2receptors (IC 50s =94 &amp; 271nM, respectively). Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors (IC 50s &gt; 5000 nM).  Effect on QT Interval  In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [ see Overdosage (10.1)  ], in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Adults  Quetiapine fumarate activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.  Children and Adolescents  At steady-state the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  Absorption  Quetiapine fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with C max and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.  Distribution  Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10±4 L/kg. It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro , quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.  Metabolism and Elimination  Following a single oral dose of 14 C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.  Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite N-desalkyl quetiapine.  Age  Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40% in elderly patients (≥ 65 years, n=9) compared to young patients (n=12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary [see  Dosage and Administration  (2.3)].  Gender  There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.  Race  There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.  Smoking  Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine.  Renal Insufficiency  Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr=10 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , n=8) had a 25% lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (Clcr &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , n=8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients.[see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  Hepatic Insufficiency  Hepatically impaired patients (n=8) had a 30% lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In two of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and Cmax were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed [see  Dosage and Administration(2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].  Drug-Drug Interaction Studies  The in vivo assessments of effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are summarized in Table 17 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  Table 17: The Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Quetiapine  Coadministered  drug  Dose schedules  Effect on  quetiapine  pharmacokinetics  Coadministered  drug  Quetiapine  Phenytoin  100 mg three times daily  250 mg three times daily  5 fold Increase in oral clearance  Divalproex  500 mg twice daily  150 mg twice daily  17% increase mean max plasma concentration at steady state.  No effect on absorption or mean oral clearance  Thioridazine  200 mg twice daily  300 mg twice daily  65% increase in oral clearance  Cimetidine  400 mg three times daily for 4 days  150 mg three times daily  20% decrease in mean oral clearance  Ketoconazole (potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor)  200 mg once daily for 4 days  25 mg single dose  84% decrease in oral clearance resulting in a 6.2 fold increase in AUC of quetiapine  Fluoxetine  60 mg once daily  300 mg twice daily  No change in steady state PK  Imipramine  75 mg twice daily  300 mg twice daily  No change in steady state PK  Haloperidol  7.5 mg twice daily  300 mg twice daily  No change in steady state PK  Risperidone  3 mg twice daily  300 mg twice daily  No change in steady state PK  In vitro enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by cytochromes CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.  Quetiapine at doses of 750 mg/day did not affect the single dose pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, lithium or lorazepam (Table 18) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].  Table 18: The Effect of Quetiapine on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs  Coadministered drug  Dose schedules  Effect on other drugs pharmacokinetics  Coadministered drug  Quetiapine  Lorazepam  2 mg, single dose  250 mg three times daily  Oral clearance of lorazepam reduced by 20%  Divalproex  500 mg twice daily  150 mg twice daily  C max and AUC of free valproic acid at steady-state was decreased by 10 to 12%  Lithium  Up to 2400 mg/day given in twice daily doses  250 mg three times daily  No effect on steady-state pharmacokinetics of lithium  Antipyrine  1 g, single dose  250 mg three times daily  No effect on clearance of antipyrine or urinary recovery of its metabolites</Section>
