CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.  Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.</Section>

<SentenceText>Some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient’s clinical response and not on the basis of plasma levels.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1182" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1183" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1184" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1185" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1186" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1187" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1188" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1189" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1190" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1191" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1192" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1193" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1194" LabelDrug="Amitriptyline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</SentenceText>
