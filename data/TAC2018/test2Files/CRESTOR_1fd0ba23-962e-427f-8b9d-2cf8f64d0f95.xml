7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  •  Cyclosporine: Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure. Limit CRESTOR dose to 5 mg once daily. ( 2.5 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 12.3 )  •  Gemfibrozil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, limit CRESTOR dose to 10 mg once daily. ( 5.1 , 7.2 )  •  Lopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure. Limit CRESTOR dose to 10 mg once daily. ( 2.5 , 5.1 , 7.3 , 12.3 )  •  Coumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs INR. Achieve stable INR prior to starting CRESTOR. Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of CRESTOR therapy. ( 5.3 , 7.4 )  •  Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with CRESTOR. ( 5.1 , 7.5 , 7.6 )  7.1 Cyclosporine  Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) 7‑fold. Therefore, in patients taking cyclosporine, the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 5 mg once daily [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.2 Gemfibrozil  Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure. Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, combination therapy with CRESTOR and gemfibrozil should be avoided. If used together, the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.3 Protease Inhibitors  Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain protease inhibitors given in combination with ritonavir has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure. The protease inhibitor combinations lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir increase rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) up to threefold [see Table 4 –  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]. For these combinations the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily. The combinations of tipranavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure. Caution should be exercised when rosuvastatin is coadministered with protease inhibitors given in combination with ritonavir [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5),  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.4 Coumarin Anticoagulants  CRESTOR significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants. Therefore, caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.5 Niacin  The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when CRESTOR is used in combination with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin; caution should be used when prescribing with CRESTOR [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  7.6 Fenofibrate  When CRESTOR was coadministered with fenofibrate, no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed. Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates, caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with CRESTOR [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.7 Colchicine  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing CRESTOR with colchicine [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  CRESTOR is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. In vivo studies in animals, and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into, and selectivity for, action in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. In in vivo and in vitro studies, rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  •  Absorption:  In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both C max and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%.    Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin.    The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration.  •  Distribution:  Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations.  •  Metabolism:  Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound.  •  Excretion:  Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.    After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route.  •  Race:  A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups. However, pharmacokinetic studies, including one conducted in the US, have demonstrated an approximate 2‑fold elevation in median exposure (AUC and C max ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group.  •  Gender:  There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women.  •  Geriatric:  There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age ≥65 years).  •  Renal Impairment:  Mild to moderate renal impairment (CL cr  ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent (about 3‑fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr  &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects (CL cr  &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).  •  Hemodialysis:  Steady-state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50% greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function.  •  Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased.    In patients with Child‑Pugh A disease, C max and AUC were increased by 60% and 5%, respectively, as compared with patients with normal liver function. In patients with Child‑Pugh B disease, C max and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function.  Drug-Drug Interactions:  Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent.  Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant administration of CRESTOR with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myopathy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].
