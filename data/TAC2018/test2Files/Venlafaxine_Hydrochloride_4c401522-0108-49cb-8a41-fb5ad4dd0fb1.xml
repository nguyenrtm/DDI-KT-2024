7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Serotonergic Drugs (e.g., MAOIs, triptans, SSRIs, other SNRIs, linezolid, lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort): Potential for serotonin syndrome. Careful patient observation is advised ( 4.2 , 5.2 , 7.3 ).  7.1 Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Drugs  The risk of using venlafaxine in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is taken in combination with other CNS-active drugs.  7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  Adverse reactions, some of which were serious, have been reported in patients who have recently been discontinued from an MAOI and started on antidepressants with pharmacological properties similar to venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release (SNRIs or SSRIs), or who have recently had SNRI or SSRI therapy discontinued prior to initiation of an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  7.3 Serotonergic Drugs  Based on the mechanism of action of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, SSRIs, other SNRIs, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. If concomitant treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and these drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. The concomitant use of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release with tryptophan supplements is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Contraindications (4.2) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)  Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. The use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake is associated with the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is initiated or discontinued.  7.5 Weight Loss Agents  The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Coadministration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release and weight loss agents is not recommended. Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.  7.6 Effects of Other Drugs on Venlafaxine hydrochloride Extended-Release  Figure 1: Effect of interacting drugs on the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV).

Note:  *: Administration of venlafaxine in a stable regimen did not exaggerate the psychomotor and psychometric effects induced by ethanol in these same subjects when they were not receiving venlafaxine.  Figure 2  7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions  False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of venlafaxine in humans is unknown, but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, through inhibition of their reuptake. Non- clinical studies have demonstrated that venlafaxine and its active metabolite, ODV, are potent and selective inhibitors of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  Venlafaxine and ODV have no significant affinity for muscarinic-cholinergic, H 1 -histaminergic, or α 1 -adrenergic receptors in vitro . Pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs. Venlafaxine and ODV do not possess monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity.  Cardiac Electrophysiology  The effect of venlafaxine on the QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QT study in 54 healthy adult subjects. No significant QT prolongation effect of venlafaxine 450 mg was detected.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV in plasma are attained within 3 days of oral multiple-dose therapy. Venlafaxine and ODV exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range of 75 to 450 mg per day. Mean±SD steady-state plasma clearance of venlafaxine and ODV is 1.3±0.6 and 0.4±0.2 L/h/kg, respectively; apparent elimination half-life is 5±2 and 11±2 hours, respectively; and apparent (steady-state) volume of distribution is 7.5±3.7 and 5.7±1.8 L/kg, respectively. Venlafaxine and ODV are minimally bound at therapeutic concentrations to plasma proteins (27% and 30%, respectively).  Absorption and Distribution  Venlafaxine is well absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver. ODV is the major active metabolite. On the basis of mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is approximately 45%.  Administration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release (150 mg once daily) generally resulted in lower C max and later T max values than for venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release administered twice daily (Table 16). When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate-release tablet or the extended-release capsule, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV was similar for the two treatments, and the fluctuation in plasma concentrations was slightly lower with the venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule. Therefore, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release provides a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate-release tablet.  Table 16: Comparison of C max and T max Values for Venlafaxine and ODV Following Oral Administration of Venlafaxine hydrochloride Extended-Release and Venlafaxine hydrochloride Immediate-Release)  Venlafaxine  ODV  C max  (ng/mL)  T max  (h)  C max  (ng/mL)  T max  (h)  Venlafaxine hydrochloride Extended-Release (150 mg once daily)  150  5.5  260  9  Venlafaxine hydrochloride Immediate-Release (75 mg twice daily)  225  2  290  3  Food did not affect the bioavailability of venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV. Time of administration (AM versus PM) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV from the 75 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule.  Venlafaxine is not highly bound to plasma proteins; therefore, administration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound should not cause increased free concentrations of the other drug.  Metabolism and Elimination  Following absorption, venlafaxine undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism in the liver, primarily to ODV, but also to N-desmethylvenlafaxine, N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine, and other minor metabolites. In vitro studies indicate that the formation of ODV is catalyzed by CYP2D6; this has been confirmed in a clinical study showing that patients with low CYP2D6 levels (poor metabolizers) had increased levels of venlafaxine and reduced levels of ODV compared to people with normal CYP2D6 levels (extensive metabolizers) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] .  Approximately 87% of a venlafaxine dose is recovered in the urine within 48 hours as unchanged venlafaxine (5%), unconjugated ODV (29%), conjugated ODV (26%), or other minor inactive metabolites (27%). Renal elimination of venlafaxine and its metabolites is thus the primary route of excretion.</Section>
