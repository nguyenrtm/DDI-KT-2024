7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Drug Interactions (not described in Contraindications or Warnings and Precautions) include the following:  Drugs Inhibiting or Metabolized by Cytochrome P450: Fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19). Carbamazepine: Elevated carbamazepine levels and symptoms of toxicity with coadministration ( 7.2 ). Sumatriptan: Rare postmarketing reports of weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following use of an SSRI and sumatriptan. Monitor appropriately if concomitant treatment is clinically warranted ( 7.2 ). Tacrine: Coadministration increased tacrine C max and AUC five- and eight-fold and caused nausea, vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea ( 7.2 ). Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Coadministration significantly increased plasma TCA levels. Use caution; monitor plasma TCA levels; reduce TCA dose if indicated ( 7.2 ). Tryptophan: Severe vomiting with coadministration ( 7.2 ). Diltiazem: Bradycardia with coadministration ( 7.3 ). Propranolol or metoprolol: Reduce dose if coadministered and titrate more cautiously ( 7.3 ).  7.1 Potential Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit or are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes  Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of a large number of structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, but some preliminary in vitro data are also available. Based on a finding of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain of these drugs [ see later parts of this section and also  Warnings and Precautions (5) ] and limited in vitro data for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as: CYP1A2 (e.g., warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam), and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole).  In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.  Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that leads to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6. Such individuals have been referred to as “poor metabolizers” (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetic properties compared to 16 “extensive metabolizers” (EM): mean C max , AUC, and half-life were increased by 52%, 200%, and 62%, respectively, in the PM compared to the EM group. This suggests that fluvoxamine is metabolized, at least in part, by CYP2D6. Caution is indicated in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity and those receiving concomitant drugs known to inhibit this cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (e.g., quinidine).  The metabolism of fluvoxamine has not been fully characterized and the effects of potent cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inhibition, such as the ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A4, on fluvoxamine metabolism have not been studied.  A clinically significant fluvoxamine interaction is possible with drugs having a narrow therapeutic ratio such as pimozide, warfarin, theophylline, certain benzodiazepines, omeprazole and phenytoin. If fluvoxamine maleate tablets are to be administered together with a drug that is eliminated via oxidative metabolism and has a narrow therapeutic window, plasma levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects of the latter drug should be monitored closely, at least until steady-state conditions are reached [see Contraindications (4)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5) ].  7.2 CNS Active Drugs  Antipsychotics  See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .  Benzodiazepines  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Alprazolam  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Diazepam  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Lorazepam  A study of multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg b.i.d.) in healthy male volunteers (N = 12) and a single dose of lorazepam (4 mg single dose) indicated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. On average, both lorazepam alone and lorazepam with fluvoxamine produced substantial decrements in cognitive functioning; however, the coadministration of fluvoxamine and lorazepam did not produce larger mean decrements compared to lorazepam alone.  Alcohol  Studies involving single 40 g doses of ethanol (oral administration in one study and intravenous in the other) and multiple dosing with fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg b.i.d.) revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other. As with other psychotropic medications, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets.  Carbamazepine  Elevated carbamazepine levels and symptoms of toxicity have been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and carbamazepine.  Clozapine  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Lithium  As with other serotonergic drugs, lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of fluvoxamine and, therefore, the combination should be used with caution. Seizures have been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and lithium.  Methadone  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  See Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) , Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .  Pimozide  See Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) .  Ramelteon  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Serotonergic Drugs  See Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) , Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .  Tacrine  In a study of 13 healthy, male volunteers, a single 40 mg dose of tacrine added to fluvoxamine 100 mg/day administered at steady-state was associated with five- and eight-fold increases in tacrine C max and AUC, respectively, compared to the administration of tacrine alone. Five subjects experienced nausea, vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea following coadministration, consistent with the cholinergic effects of tacrine.  Thioridazine  See Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) .  Tizanidine  See Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) .  Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)  Significantly increased plasma TCA levels have been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and amitriptyline, clomipramine or imipramine. Caution is indicated with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and TCAs; plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced.  Triptans  There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of fluvoxamine with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  Sumatriptan  There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.  Tryptophan  Tryptophan may enhance the serotonergic effects of fluvoxamine, and the combination should, therefore, be used with caution. Severe vomiting has been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and tryptophan [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  7.3 Other Drugs  Alosetron  See Contraindications (4.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Lotronex™(alosetron) package insert.  Digoxin  Administration of fluvoxamine maleate 100 mg daily for 18 days (N = 8) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a 1.25 mg single intravenous dose of digoxin.  Diltiazem  Bradycardia has been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and diltiazem.  Mexiletine  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Propranolol and Other Beta-Blockers  Coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate 100 mg per day and propranolol 160 mg per day in normal volunteers resulted in a mean five-fold increase (range 2 to 17) in minimum propranolol plasma concentrations. In this study, there was a slight potentiation of the propranolol-induced reduction in heart rate and reduction in the exercise diastolic pressure.  One case of bradycardia and hypotension and a second case of orthostatic hypotension have been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and metoprolol.  If propranolol or metoprolol is coadministered with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, a reduction in the initial beta-blocker dose and more cautious dose titration are recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets.  Coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate 100 mg per day with atenolol 100 mg per day (N = 6) did not affect the plasma concentrations of atenolol. Unlike propranolol and metoprolol which undergo hepatic metabolism, atenolol is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.  Theophylline  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8) .  Warfarin and Other Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, etc.)  See Warnings and Precautions (5.8 and 5.10) .  7.4 Effects of Smoking on Fluvoxamine Metabolism  Smokers had a 25% increase in the metabolism of fluvoxamine compared to nonsmokers.  7.5 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)  There are no clinical studies establishing the benefits or risks of combined use of ECT and fluvoxamine maleate.</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  The mechanism of action of fluvoxamine maleate in obsessive compulsive disorder is presumed to be linked to its specific serotonin reuptake inhibition in brain neurons. Fluvoxamine has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the serotonin reuptake transporter in preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo .  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  In in vitro studies, fluvoxamine maleate had no significant affinity for histaminergic, alpha or beta adrenergic, muscarinic, or dopaminergic receptors. Antagonism of some of these receptors is thought to be associated with various sedative, cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects of some psychotropic drugs.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Absorption  The absolute bioavailability of fluvoxamine maleate is 53%. Oral bioavailability is not significantly affected by food.  In a dose proportionality study involving fluvoxamine maleate at 100, 200 and 300 mg/day for 10 consecutive days in 30 normal volunteers, steady state was achieved after about a week of dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations at steady state occurred within 3 to 8 hours of dosing and reached concentrations averaging 88, 283 and 546 ng/mL, respectively. Thus, fluvoxamine had nonlinear pharmacokinetics over this dose range, i.e., higher doses of fluvoxamine maleate produced disproportionately higher concentrations than predicted from the lower dose.  Distribution  The mean apparent volume of distribution for fluvoxamine is approximately 25 L/kg, suggesting extensive tissue distribution.  Approximately 80% of fluvoxamine is bound to plasma protein, mostly albumin, over a concentration range of 20 to 2000 ng/mL.  Metabolism  Fluvoxamine maleate is extensively metabolized by the liver; the main metabolic routes are oxidative demethylation and deamination. Nine metabolites were identified following a 5 mg radiolabelled dose of fluvoxamine maleate, constituting approximately 85% of the urinary excretion products of fluvoxamine. The main human metabolite was fluvoxamine acid which, together with its N-acetylated analog, accounted for about 60% of the urinary excretion products. A third metabolite, fluvoxethanol, formed by oxidative deamination, accounted for about 10%. Fluvoxamine acid and fluvoxethanol were tested in an in vitro assay of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition in rats; they were inactive except for a weak effect of the former metabolite on inhibition of serotonin uptake (1-2 orders of magnitude less potent than the parent compound). Approximately 2% of fluvoxamine was excreted in urine unchanged [see Drug Interactions (7) ].  Elimination  Following a 14 C-labelled oral dose of fluvoxamine maleate (5 mg), an average of 94% of drug-related products was recovered in the urine within 71 hours.  The mean plasma half-life of fluvoxamine at steady state after multiple oral doses of 100 mg/day in healthy, young volunteers was 15.6 hours.  Elderly Subjects  In a study of fluvoxamine maleate tablets at 50 and 100 mg comparing elderly (ages 66-73) and young subjects (ages 19-35), mean maximum plasma concentrations in the elderly were 40% higher. The multiple dose elimination half-life of fluvoxamine was 17.4 and 25.9 hours in the elderly compared to 13.6 and 15.6 hours in the young subjects at steady state for 50 and 100 mg doses, respectively. In elderly patients, the clearance of fluvoxamine was reduced by about 50% and, therefore, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be slowly titrated during initiation of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ].  Pediatric Subjects  The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine were determined in male and female children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17). Steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations were 2-3 fold higher in children than in adolescents. AUC and C max in children were 1.5- to 2.7-fold higher than that in adolescents. (See Table 4.) As in adults, both children and adolescents exhibited nonlinear multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. Female children showed significantly higher AUC (0-12) and C max compared to male children and, therefore, lower doses of fluvoxamine maleate tablets may produce therapeutic benefit. (See Table 5.) No gender differences were observed in adolescents. Steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations were similar in adults and adolescents at a dose of 300 mg/day, indicating that fluvoxamine exposure was similar in these two populations. (See Table 4.) Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].  TABLE 4: COMPARISON OF MEAN (SD) FLUVOXAMINE PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS BETWEEN CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND ADULTS  Pharmacokinetic Parameter (body weight corrected)  Dose = 200 mg/day  (100 mg b.i.d.)  Dose = 300 mg/day  (150 mg b.i.d.)  Children  (N = 10)  Adolescent (N = 17)  Adolescent (N = 13)  Adult  (N = 16)  AUC 0-12 (ng•h/mL/kg)  155.1 (160.9)  43.9 (27.9)  69.6 (46.6)  59.4 (40.9)  C max (ng/mL/kg)  14.8 (14.9)  4.2 (2.6)  6.7 (4.2)  5.7 (3.9)  C min (ng/mL/kg)  11.0 (11.9)  2.9 (2.0)  4.8 (3.8)  4.6 (3.2)  TABLE 5: COMPARISON OF MEAN (SD) FLUVOXAMINE PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE CHILDREN (6-11 YEARS)  Pharmacokinetic Parameter (body weight corrected)  Dose = 200 mg/day (100 mg b.i.d.)  Male Children  (N = 7)  Female Children  (N = 3)  AUC 0-12 (ng•h/mL/kg)  95.8 (83.9)  293.5 (233.0)  C max (ng/mL/kg)  9.1 (7.6)  28.1 (21.1)  C min (ng/mL/kg)  6.6 (6.1)  21.2 (17.6)  Hepatic and Renal Disease  A cross study comparison (healthy subjects versus patients with hepatic dysfunction) suggested a 30% decrease in fluvoxamine clearance in association with hepatic dysfunction. The mean minimum plasma concentrations in renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance of 5 to 45 mL/min) after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment (50 mg b.i.d., N = 13) were comparable to each other, suggesting no accumulation of fluvoxamine in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions: Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness (5.14) ].</Section>
