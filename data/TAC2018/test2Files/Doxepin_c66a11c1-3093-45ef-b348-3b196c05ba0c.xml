CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Although doxepin HCl does have H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking actions, the exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its antipruritic effect is unknown. PRUDOXIN Cream can produce drowsiness which may reduce awareness, including awareness of pruritic symptoms. In 19 pruritic eczema patients treated with PRUDOXIN Cream, plasma doxepin concentrations ranged from nondetectable to 47 ng/mL from percutaneous absorption. Plasma levels from topical application of PRUDOXIN Cream can result in CNS and other systemic side effects.  Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, doxepin undergoes hepatic metabolism that results in conversion to pharmacologically-active desmethyldoxepin. Further glucuronidation results in urinary excretion of the parent drug and its metabolites. Desmethyldoxepin has a half-life that ranges from 28 to 52 hours and is not affected by multiple dosing. Plasma levels of both doxepin and desmethyldoxepin are highly variable and are poorly correlated with dosage. Wide distribution occurs in body tissues including lungs, heart, brain, and liver. Renal disease, genetic factors, age, and other medications affect the metabolism and subsequent elimination of doxepin. (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions .)</Section>

<SentenceText>Studies have not been performed examining drug interactions with PRUDOXIN Cream.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="120" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>However, since plasma levels of doxepin following topical application of PRUDOXIN Cream can reach levels obtained with oral doxepin HCl therapy, the following drug interactions are possible following topical PRUDOXIN Cream application: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6: The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7-10% of Caucasians are so-called "poor metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="121" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="122" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="123" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="124" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>An individual who is stable on a given dosage regimen of a TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="125" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="126" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="127" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="128" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="129" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="130" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="131" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="132" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>MAO Inhibitors: Serious side effects and even death have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAO inhibitors.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="133" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Therefore, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with PRUDOXIN Cream.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="134" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The exact length of time may vary and is dependent upon the particular MAO inhibitor being used, the length of time it has been administered, and the dosage involved.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="135" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Cimetidine: Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is initiated.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="136" LabelDrug="Doxepin" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine.</SentenceText>

<SentenceText>Alcohol: Alcohol ingestion may exacerbate the potential sedative effects of PRUDOXIN Cream.</SentenceText>
