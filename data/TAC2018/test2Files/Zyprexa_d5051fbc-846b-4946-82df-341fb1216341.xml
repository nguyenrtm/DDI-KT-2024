7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Diazepam: May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) Alcohol: May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. ( 7.1 ) Carbamazepine: Increased clearance of olanzapine. ( 7.1 ) Fluvoxamine: May increase olanzapine levels. ( 7.1 ) ZYPREXA and Fluoxetine in Combination: Also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. ( 7.1 ) CNS Acting Drugs: Caution should be used when taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. ( 7.2 ) Antihypertensive Agents: Enhanced antihypertensive effect. ( 7.2 ) Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists: May antagonize levodopa/dopamine agonists. ( 7.2 ) Lorazepam (IM): Increased somnolence with IM olanzapine. ( 7.2 ) Other Concomitant Drug Therapy: When using olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate, refer to the Drug Interactions sections of the package insert for those products. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine Diazepam — The co-administration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Cimetidine and Antacids — Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2 — Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Alcohol — Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The co-administration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Inhibitors of CYP1A2  Fluvoxamine: Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. Inhibitors of CYP2D6  Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using ZYPREXA and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax. Warfarin — Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase — Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. Charcoal — The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. 7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs CNS Acting Drugs — Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Antihypertensive Agents — Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists — Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Lorazepam (IM) — Administration of intramuscular lorazepam (2 mg) 1 hour after intramuscular olanzapine for injection (5 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, unconjugated lorazepam, or total lorazepam. However, this co-administration of intramuscular lorazepam and intramuscular olanzapine for injection added to the somnolence observed with either drug alone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Lithium — Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . Valproate — Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes — In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. Imipramine — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine. Warfarin — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Diazepam — Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam. However, diazepam co-administered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Alcohol — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Biperiden — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. Theophylline — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites.</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT 2 ) antagonism. The mechanism of action of olanzapine in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors: serotonin 5HT 2A/2C , 5HT 6 (K i =4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D 1-4 (K i =11-31 nM), histamine H 1 (K i =7 nM), and adrenergic α 1 receptors (K i =19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT 3 (K i =57 nM) and muscarinic M 1-5 (K i =73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA A , BZD, and β-adrenergic receptors (K i &gt;10 μM). Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT 2 may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of olanzapine. Olanzapine's antagonism of muscarinic M 1-5 receptors may explain its anticholinergic-like effects. Olanzapine's antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Olanzapine's antagonism of adrenergic α 1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Oral Administration, Monotherapy — Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations in approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40% of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ZYPREXA tablets and ZYPREXA ZYDIS (olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets) dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent. Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half-life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 25 L/hr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady-state concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half-life, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age. Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ng/mL, binding primarily to albumin and α 1 -acid glycoprotein. Metabolism and Elimination — Following a single oral dose of 14 C labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4′-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme. Intramuscular Administration — ZYPREXA IntraMuscular results in rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 15 to 45 minutes. Based upon a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, a 5 mg dose of intramuscular olanzapine for injection produces, on average, a maximum plasma concentration approximately 5 times higher than the maximum plasma concentration produced by a 5 mg dose of oral olanzapine. Area under the curve achieved after an intramuscular dose is similar to that achieved after oral administration of the same dose. The half-life observed after intramuscular administration is similar to that observed after oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics are linear over the clinical dosing range. Metabolic profiles after intramuscular administration are qualitatively similar to metabolic profiles after oral administration. Specific Populations  Renal Impairment — Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment — Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n=6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh Classification A and B) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. Geriatric — In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (≥65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (&lt;65 years). Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism and/or pharmacodynamic sensitivity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Gender — Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. Smoking Status — Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended. Race — In vivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended. Combined Effects — The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) — In clinical studies, most adolescents were nonsmokers and this population had a lower average body weight, which resulted in higher average olanzapine exposure compared to adults.</Section>

<SentenceText>Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1365" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1366" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4′-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1367" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1368" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Direct glucuronidation and cytochromeP450(CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1369" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Invitro studies suggest that CYPs1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1370" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway invivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme.</SentenceText>

<SentenceText>Intramuscular Administration — ZYPREXA IntraMuscular results in rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 15 to 45 minutes.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1372" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Based upon a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, a 5mg dose of intramuscular olanzapine for injection produces, on average, a maximum plasma concentration approximately 5 times higher than the maximum plasma concentration produced by a 5mg dose of oral olanzapine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1373" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Area under the curve achieved after an intramuscular dose is similar to that achieved after oral administration of the same dose.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1374" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The half-life observed after intramuscular administration is similar to that observed after oral dosing.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1375" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The pharmacokinetics are linear over the clinical dosing range.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1376" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Metabolic profiles after intramuscular administration are qualitatively similar to metabolic profiles after oral administration.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1377" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Specific Populations Renal Impairment — Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1378" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1379" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1380" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The effect of renal impairment on metabolite elimination has not been studied.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1381" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Hepatic Impairment — Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (n=6) with clinically significant (Childs Pugh ClassificationA andB) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1382" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Geriatric — In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly (≥65 years) than in nonelderly subjects (&lt;65 years).</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1383" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism and/or pharmacodynamic sensitivity.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1384" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Gender — Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1385" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1386" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1387" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Smoking Status — Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely recommended.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1388" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Race — Invivo studies have shown that exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1389" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Dosage modifications for race are, therefore, not recommended.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1390" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Combined Effects — The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1391" LabelDrug="Zyprexa" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The clearance in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females.</SentenceText>
