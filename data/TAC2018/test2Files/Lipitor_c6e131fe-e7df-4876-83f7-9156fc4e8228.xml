7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ( 2.6 , 5.1 , 7 , 12.3 )  Interacting Agents  Prescribing Recommendations  Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir)  Avoid atorvastatin  HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir)  Use with caution and lowest dose necessary  Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir)  Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily  HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir) Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir)  Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily  Other Lipid-Lowering Medications: Use with fibrate products or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with LIPITOR ( 7 ).  Digoxin: Patients should be monitored appropriately ( 7.8 ).  Oral Contraceptives: Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased ( 7.9 ).  Rifampin should be simultaneously co-administered with LIPITOR ( 7.7 ).  7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4  LIPITOR is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of LIPITOR with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.  Clarithromycin  Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the LIPITOR dose exceeds 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  Combination of Protease Inhibitors  Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of LIPITOR should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing LIPITOR and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of LIPITOR should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of LIPITOR should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended.  Itraconazole  Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the LIPITOR dose exceeds 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  7.2 Grapefruit Juice  Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (&gt;1.2 liters per day).  7.3 Cyclosporine  Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of LIPITOR alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The co-administration of LIPITOR with cyclosporine should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  7.4 Gemfibrozil  Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are co-administered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of LIPITOR with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  7.5 Other Fibrates  Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, LIPITOR should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  7.6 Niacin  The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when LIPITOR is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in LIPITOR dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4  Concomitant administration of LIPITOR with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous co-administration of LIPITOR with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of LIPITOR after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.  7.8 Digoxin  When multiple doses of LIPITOR and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.  7.9 Oral Contraceptives  Co-administration of LIPITOR and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking LIPITOR.  7.10 Warfarin  LIPITOR had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.  7.11 Colchicine  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  LIPITOR is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In animal models, LIPITOR lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; LIPITOR also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  LIPITOR, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] .  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Absorption: LIPITOR is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to LIPITOR dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether LIPITOR is given with or without food. Plasma LIPITOR concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] .  Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of LIPITOR is approximately 381 liters. LIPITOR is ≥98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, LIPITOR is likely to be secreted in human milk [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .  Metabolism: LIPITOR is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of LIPITOR. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of LIPITOR metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of LIPITOR in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.  Excretion: LIPITOR and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of LIPITOR in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of LIPITOR is recovered in urine following oral administration.  Specific Populations  Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of LIPITOR are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .  Pediatric: Apparent oral clearance of atorvastatin in pediatric subjects appeared similar to that of adults when scaled allometrically by body weight as the body weight was the only significant covariate in atorvastatin population PK model with data including pediatric HeFH patients (ages 10 years to 17 years of age, n=29) in an open-label, 8-week study.  Gender: Plasma concentrations of LIPITOR in women differ from those in men (approximately 20% higher for Cmax and 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with LIPITOR between men and women.  Renal Impairment: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of LIPITOR; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  Hemodialysis: While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of LIPITOR since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.  Hepatic Impairment: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of LIPITOR are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Contraindications (4) ] .  TABLE 4.

<Sentence id="3122" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3123" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In vitro studies suggest the importance of LIPITOR metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of LIPITOR in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3124" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3125" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Excretion: LIPITOR and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3126" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Mean plasma elimination half-life of LIPITOR in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3127" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Less than 2% of a dose of LIPITOR is recovered in urine following oral administration.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3128" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Specific Populations Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of LIPITOR are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥65 years) than in young adults.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3129" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3130" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Pediatric: Apparent oral clearance of atorvastatin in pediatric subjects appeared similar to that of adults when scaled allometrically by body weight as the body weight was the only significant covariate in atorvastatin population PK model with data including pediatric HeFH patients (ages 10 years to 17 years of age, n=29) in an open-label, 8-week study.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3131" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Gender: Plasma concentrations of LIPITOR in women differ from those in men (approximately 20% higher for Cmax and 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with LIPITOR between men and women.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3132" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Renal Impairment: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of LIPITOR; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="3133" LabelDrug="Lipitor" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Hemodialysis: While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of LIPITOR since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
