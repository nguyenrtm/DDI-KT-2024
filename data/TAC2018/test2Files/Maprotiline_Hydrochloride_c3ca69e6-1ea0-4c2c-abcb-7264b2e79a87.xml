CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  The mechanism of action of maprotiline is not precisely known. It does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system and is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The postulated mechanism of maprotiline is that it acts primarily by potentiation of central adrenergic synapses by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. This pharmacologic action is thought to be responsible for the drug's antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.  The mean time to peak is 12 hours. The half-life of elimination averages 51 hours.  Steady-state levels measured prior to the morning dose on a one dosage regimen are summarized as follows:  Average Minimum Concentration  95% Confidence Limits  Regimen  ng/mL  ng/mL  50 mg × 3 daily  238  181–295</Section>

<SentenceText>Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when administering maprotiline concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs because of the possibility of additive atropine like effects.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="4321" LabelDrug="Maprotiline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Concurrent administration of maprotiline with electroshock therapy should be avoided because of the lack of experience in this area.</SentenceText>

<SentenceText>Caution should be exercised when administering maprotiline to hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication because of the possibility of enhanced potential for cardiovascular toxicity of maprotiline.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="4323" LabelDrug="Maprotiline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Maprotiline should be used with caution in patients receiving guanethidine or similar agents since it may block the pharmacologic effects of these drugs.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="4324" LabelDrug="Maprotiline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>The risk of seizures may be increased when maprotiline is taken concomitantly with phenothiazines or when the dosage of benzodiazepines is rapidly tapered in patients receiving maprotiline.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="4325" LabelDrug="Maprotiline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Because of the pharmacologic similarity of maprotiline hydrochloride to the tricyclic antidepressants, the plasma concentration of maprotiline may be increased when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by concomitant administration with hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), as has occurred with tricyclic antidepressants.</SentenceText>

<Sentence id="4326" LabelDrug="Maprotiline Hydrochloride" section="34073-7">
<SentenceText>Adjustment of the dosage of maprotiline hydrochloride may therefore be necessary in such cases.</SentenceText>
