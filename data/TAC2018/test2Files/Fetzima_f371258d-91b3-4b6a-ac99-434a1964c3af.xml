7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other than CYP3A4 drug interactions, FETZIMA is predicted, based on in vitro studies, to have a low potential to be involved in clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole : Do not exceed 80 mg once daily ( 7 ). 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]  7.2 Serotonergic Drugs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]  7.3 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when FETZIMA is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.4 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect FETZIMA Dose adjustment is recommended when FETZIMA is co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. An in vivo study showed a clinically meaningful increase in levomilnacipran exposure when FETZIMA was co-administered with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (see  Figure 1  ). No dose adjustment of FETZIMA is needed when co-administered with a CYP3A4 inducer or substrate. In vivo studies showed no clinically meaningful change in levomilnacipran exposure when co-administered with the CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine or the CYP3A4 substrate alprazolam (see  Figure 1  ). No dose adjustment of FETZIMA is needed when co-administered with inhibitors of CYP2C8 , CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2J2, P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. In vitro studies suggested that CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2J2 had minimal contributions to metabolism of levomilnacipran. In addition, levomilnacipran is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 and is a weak substrate of P-gp.  Figure 1 PK Interactions between Levomilnacipran (LVM) and Other Drugs  Figure 1 7.5 Potential for FETZIMA to Affect Other Drugs No dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is recommended when FETZIMA is administered with a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. In vitro studies have shown that levomilnacipran is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. Concomitant use of FETZIMA with alprazolam or carbamazepine, substrates of CYP3A4, had no significant effect on alprazolam or carbamazepine plasma concentrations (see  Figure 1  ). 7.6 Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Agents The risk of using FETZIMA in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when FETZIMA is prescribed in combination with other CNS-active drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action. Alcohol  In an in vitro study, alcohol interacted with the extended-release properties of FETZIMA. If FETZIMA is taken with alcohol, a pronounced accelerated drug release may occur. It is recommended that FETZIMA extended-release capsules not be taken with alcohol.</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of levomilnacipran is unknown, but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, through inhibition of reuptake at serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. Non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the human serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) transporters (Ki = 11 and 91 nM, respectively) and potently inhibits 5-HT and NE reuptake (IC50 = 16-19 and 11 nM, respectively). Levomilnacipran lacks significant affinity for any other receptors, ion channels or transporters tested in vitro , including serotonergic (5HT1-7), α- and β- adrenergic, muscarinic, or histaminergic receptors and Ca2+, Na+, K+ or Cl- channels. Levomilnacipran did not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). Cardiovascular Electrophysiology  At a dose 2.5 times the maximum recommended dose, levomilnacipran does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The concentration of levomilnacipran at steady state is proportional to dose when administered from 25 to 300 mg once daily. Following an oral administration, the mean apparent total clearance of levomilnacipran is 21-29 L/h. Steady-state concentrations of levomilnacipran are predictable from single-dose data. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of levomilnacipran is approximately 12 hours. After daily dosing of FETZIMA 120 mg, the mean C max value is 341 ng/mL, and the mean steady-state AUC value is 5196 ng·h/mL. Interconversion between levomilnacipran and its stereoisomer does not occur in humans. Absorption  The relative bioavailability of levomilnacipran after administration of FETZIMA ER was 92% when compared to oral solution. Levomilnacipran concentration was not significantly affected when FETZIMA was administered with food. The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) of levomilnacipran is 6-8 hours after oral administration. Distribution  Levomilnacipran is widely distributed with an apparent volume of distribution of 387-473 L; plasma protein binding is 22% over concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism  Levomilnacipran undergoes desethylation to form desethyl levomilnacipran and hydroxylation to form p-hydroxy-levomilnacipran. Both oxidative metabolites undergo further conjugation with glucuronide to form conjugates. The desethylation is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution by CYP2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 2J2 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 , 7.5 )].  Elimination/Excretion  Levomilnacipran and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Following oral administration of 14C-levomilnacipran solution, approximately 58% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged levomilnacipran. N-desethyl levomilnacipran is the major metabolite excreted in the urine and accounted for approximately 18% of the dose. Other identifiable metabolites excreted in the urine are levomilnacipran glucuronide (4%), desethyl levomilnacipran glucuronide (3%), p-hydroxy levomilnacipran glucuronide (1%), and p-hydroxy levomilnacipran (1%). The metabolites are inactive [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] .</Section>
