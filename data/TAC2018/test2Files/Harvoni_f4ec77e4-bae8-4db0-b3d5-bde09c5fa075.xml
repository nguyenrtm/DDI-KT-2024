7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Coadministration with amiodarone may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. Use of HARVONI with amiodarone is not recommended. ( 5.2 , 6.2 , 7.2 )  P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort): May alter concentrations of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers is not recommended. ( 5.3 , 7 , 12.3 )  Frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) values is recommended in patients receiving warfarin. ( 7.1 )  Consult the full prescribing information prior to use for potential drug interactions. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 7 , 12.3 )  7.1 Potential for Drug Interaction  As HARVONI contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with HARVONI.  After oral administration of HARVONI, sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic extraction. In clinical pharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and the inactive metabolite GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses.  Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters.  Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .  Fluctuations in INR values may occur in patients receiving warfarin concomitant with HCV treatment, including treatment with HARVONI. Frequent monitoring of INR values is recommended during treatment and post-treatment follow-up.  7.2 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Table 5 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either HARVONI, the components of HARVONI (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) as individual agents, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Table 5 Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction This table is not all inclusive.  Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name  Effect on Concentration ↓ = decrease, ↑ = increase  Clinical Comment  tenofovir DF = tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  Acid Reducing Agents:  ↓ ledipasvir  Ledipasvir solubility decreases as pH increases.

Coadministration is not recommended.  Antimycobacterials:  rifabutin rifampin  rifapentine  ↓ ledipasvir ↓ sofosbuvir  Coadministration of HARVONI with rifabutin or rifapentine is expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Coadministration is not recommended. Coadministration of HARVONI with rifampin, a P-gp inducer, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].  HIV Antiretrovirals:  Regimens containing tenofovir DF without an HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat  ↑ tenofovir  Monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions in patients receiving HARVONI concomitantly with a regimen containing tenofovir DF without an HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  HARVONI is a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir which are direct-acting antiviral agents against the hepatitis C virus [see Microbiology (12.4) ].  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  Cardiac Electrophysiology  Thorough QT studies have been conducted for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.  The effect of ledipasvir 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage) for 10 days on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, multiple-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) three period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects. At the dose of 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage), ledipasvir does not prolong QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.  The effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (maximum recommended dosage) and 1200 mg (three times the maximum recommended dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects. At a dose three times the maximum recommended dose, sofosbuvir does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Absorption  The pharmacokinetic properties of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of HARVONI, ledipasvir median peak concentrations were observed 4 to 4.5 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed ~0.8 to 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed between 3.5 to 4 hours post-dose.  Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects, geometric mean steady-state AUC 0–24 for ledipasvir (N=2113), sofosbuvir (N=1542), and GS-331007 (N=2113) were 7290, 1320, and 12,000 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. Steady-state C max for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were 323, 618, and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC 0–24 and C max were similar in healthy adult subjects and subjects with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects (N=191), ledipasvir AUC 0–24 and C max were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected subjects.  Effect of Food  Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of HARVONI with a moderate fat (~600 kcal, 25% to 30% fat) or high fat (~1000 kcal, 50% fat) meal increased sofosbuvir AUC 0–inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not significantly affect sofosbuvir C max . The exposures of GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered in the presence of either meal type. The response rates in Phase 3 trials were similar in HCV-infected subjects who received HARVONI with food or without food. HARVONI can be administered without regard to food.  Distribution  Ledipasvir is greater than 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins. After a single 90 mg dose of [ 14 C]-ledipasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14 C-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66.  Sofosbuvir is approximately 61–65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 microgram/mL to 20 microgram/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [ 14 C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14 C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7.  Metabolism  In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg [ 14 C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure was almost exclusively to the parent drug (greater than 98%). Unchanged ledipasvir is the major species present in feces.  Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. After a single 400 mg oral dose of [ 14 C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately greater than 90% of total systemic exposure.  Elimination  Following a single 90 mg oral dose of [ 14 C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [ 14 C]-radioactivity in feces and urine was approximately 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from feces (approximately 86%). Unchanged ledipasvir excreted in feces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and the oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data indicate that biliary excretion of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination, with renal excretion being a minor pathway (approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir following administration of HARVONI was 47 hours.  Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [ 14 C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, feces, and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-331007. The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of HARVONI were 0.5 and 27 hours, respectively.  Specific Populations  Race: Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007.  Gender: Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that gender had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007. AUC and C max of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, respectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir exposures was not considered clinically relevant, as high response rates (SVR12 &gt;90%) were achieved in male and female subjects across the Phase 3 studies and the safety profiles are similar in females and males.  Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were determined in 100 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older infected with HCV genotype 1 receiving a daily dose of HARVONI (90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir). The pharmacokinetic properties of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older are provided in Table 6. Exposures in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults.  Table 6 Pharmacokinetic Properties of the Components of HARVONI in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Population PK derived parameters  Geometric Mean  Ledipasvir Ledipasvir N=100; Sofosbuvir N=72; GS-331007 N=100  Sofosbuvir  GS-331007  AUC tau (ng∙hr/mL)  11200  1350  13600  C max (ng/mL)  550  660  921  The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] .  Geriatric Patients: Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (18 to 80 years) analyzed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .  Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault). No clinically relevant differences in ledipasvir pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment.  The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative subjects with mild (eGFR between 50 to less than 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (eGFR between 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir. Relative to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater than 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the sofosbuvir AUC 0–inf was 61%, 107%, and 171% higher in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC 0–inf was 55%, 88%, and 451% higher, respectively. In subjects with ESRD, relative to subjects with normal renal function, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC 0–inf was 28% and 1280% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour before hemodialysis compared with 60% and 2070% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour after hemodialysis, respectively. A 4 hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 18% of administered dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].  Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ledipasvir plasma exposure (AUC 0–inf ) was similar in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and control subjects with normal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ledipasvir [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] .  The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in HCV-infected subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C). Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC 0–24 were 126% and 143% higher in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC 0–24 were 18% and 9% higher, respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] .  Drug Interaction Studies  Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Coadministration with drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; HARVONI may be coadministered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. Neither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir is a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. GS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters, including organic anion transporter OAT1 or OAT3, or organic cation transporter OCT2.  Ledipasvir is subject to slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism. In vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir by CYP enzymes has been observed. Biliary excretion of unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination. Sofosbuvir is not a substrate for CYP and UGT1A1 enzymes. Clinically significant drug interactions with HARVONI mediated by CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected.  The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are shown in Table 7 [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].

Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BSEP only at concentrations exceeding those achieved in clinic. Ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of transporters MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, and OCT1. The drug-drug interaction potential of ledipasvir is primarily limited to the intestinal inhibition of P-gp and BCRP. Clinically relevant transporter inhibition by ledipasvir in the systemic circulation is not expected due to its high protein binding. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1, and GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1.  Ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes.  The effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 8 [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].

Resistance selection in cell culture and cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action.  Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is required for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotypes 1b and 4a with IC 50 values of 3.3 and 2.7 microM, respectively. GS-461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase.  Antiviral Activity  In HCV replicon assays, the EC 50 values of ledipasvir against full-length replicons from genotypes 1a and 1b were 0.031 nM and 0.004 nM, respectively. The median EC 50 values of ledipasvir against chimeric replicons encoding NS5A sequences from clinical isolates from treatment-naïve HCV-infected subjects were 0. 02 nM for genotype 1a (range 0.007–1.0 nM; N=23) and 0.006 nM for genotype 1b (range 0.002–1.0 nM; N=34). Ledipasvir had median EC 50 values ranging between 0.002 nM to 0.16 nM against 11 genotype 4 subtypes (4a, 4d, 4n, 4r, 4o, 4c, 4f, 4k, 4l, 4m and 4t). The median EC 50 value for subtype 4b was 199.6 nM (range 0.66–1799 nM; N=3); the two 4b isolates with EC 50 values greater than 100 nM had NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms L30S+M31M+P58S+Y93H. The median EC 50 value of ledipasvir was 0.03 nM against genotype 5a isolates (range 0.008–0.081 nM; N=35). For genotype 6, the EC 50 values for ledipasvir varied by subtype. Subtypes 6a and 6h had median EC 50 values of 0.55 and 0.17 nM, respectively. For subtypes 6e, 6l, 6n, 6q, 6k and 6m, the median EC 50 values ranged from 60.6 nM to 430.1 nM.  In HCV replicon assays, the EC 50 values of sofosbuvir against full-length replicons from genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4a, and chimeric 1b replicons encoding NS5B from genotypes 5a or 6a ranged from 14–110 nM. The median EC 50 value of sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons encoding NS5B sequences from clinical isolates was 62 nM for genotype 1a (range 29–128 nM; N=67) and 102 nM for genotype 1b (range 45–170 nM; N=29). In replication competent virus assays, the EC 50 value of sofosbuvir against genotype 1a was 30 nM. Evaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with ledipasvir showed no antagonistic effect in reducing HCV RNA levels in replicon cells.  Resistance  In Cell Culture  HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for genotypes 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A amino acid substitution Y93H in both genotypes 1a and 1b. Additionally, a Q30E substitution emerged in genotype 1a replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H in both genotypes 1a and 1b, as well as the Q30E substitution in genotype 1a, conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir (fold change in EC 50 greater than 1000-fold).  HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple genotypes including 1b, 4a, 5a, and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated with the NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. An M289L substitution developed along with the S282T substitution in genotype 5 and 6 replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir.  In Clinical Trials  Genotype 1  In a pooled analysis of subjects who received HARVONI in Phase 3 trials (ION-3, ION-1, and ION-2), 37 subjects (29 with genotype 1a HCV and 8 with genotype 1b HCV) qualified for resistance analysis due to virologic failure (35 with virologic relapse, 2 with breakthrough on-treatment due to documented non-adherence). Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep nucleotide sequence analysis data (assay sensitivity of 1%) were available for 37/37 and 36/37 subjects' viruses, respectively.  Of the 29 genotype 1a virologic failure subjects, 55% (16/29) of subjects had virus with emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions K24R, M28T/V, Q30R/H/K/L, L31M, or Y93H/N at failure. Five of these 16 subjects' viruses also had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated amino acid positions. The most common substitutions detected at failure were Q30R, Y93H or N, and L31M.  Of the 8 genotype 1b virologic failure subjects, 88% (7/8) had virus with emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions L31V/M/I or Y93H at failure. Virus from three of these 7 subjects also had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions. The most common substitution detected at failure was Y93H.  At failure, 38% (14/37) of virologic failure subjects' viruses had 2 or more NS5A substitutions at resistance-associated positions.  In the SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 trials (liver transplant recipients or subjects with decompensated liver disease), there were 24 virologic failures with genotype 1 infection (20 relapsers and 4 subjects who discontinued treatment prior to achieving HCV RNA &lt;LLOQ). Treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions K24R, M28T, Q30R/H/K, L31V, H58D/P, and/or Y93H/C were detected in 14/17 (82%) genotype 1a virologic failure subjects, and R30Q, L31M, and/or Y93H/N were detected in 6/7 (86%) genotype 1b virologic failure subjects.  In phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from subjects who harbored NS5A resistance-associated substitutions at failure showed 20- to &gt;243-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir.  Treatment-emergent NS5B substitutions L159 (n=1) and V321 (n=2) previously associated with sofosbuvir failure were detected in the Phase 3 trials (ION-3, ION-1, and ION-2). In addition, treatment-emergent NS5B substitutions at highly conserved positions D61G (n=3), A112T (n=2), E237G (n=2), and S473T (n=1) were detected at low frequency by next generation sequencing in treatment failure subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a. The D61G substitution was previously described in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a in a liver pre-transplant trial. The E237G substitution was detected in 3 subjects infected with HCV GT1a in the SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 trials. The clinical significance of these substitutions is currently unknown. The sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any failure isolate from the Phase 3 trials. NS5B substitutions S282T, L320V/I, and V321I in combination with NS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H, and Q30L were detected in one subject at failure following 8 weeks of treatment with HARVONI in a Phase 2 trial.  Genotype 4, 5 or 6  Resistance analysis was performed for 6 relapse subjects infected with HCV genotype 4 (Study 1119 and ION-4, N=3), genotype 5 (Study 1119, N=2) or genotype 6 (ELECTRON-2, N=1) and treated with HARVONI for 12 weeks. All the relapse subjects with NS5A sequencing data (5 of 6) had pretreatment NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms (single or combinations at positions 24, 28, 30, 31, and 58). NS5A resistance substitutions (Y93C or L28V) emerged in two of the genotype 4 relapse subjects post-treatment who also had NS5A polymorphisms pretreatment that were retained post-treatment. Two of the relapsers with genotype 4 HCV infection had an NS5B V321I substitution pretreatment, which was retained post-treatment. Three of the relapse subjects (1 each for genotype 4, 5, and 6) had virus with emergent sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T at relapse; the genotype 5 relapse subject also had emergent nucleotide inhibitor substitution M289I.  Persistence of Resistance-Associated Substitutions  No data are available on the persistence of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitutions. NS5A resistance-associated substitutions for other NS5A inhibitors have been found to persist for &gt;1 year in some patients. The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing ledipasvir or sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitutions is unknown.  Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response  Adults  Genotype 1  Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions and relapse rates. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 trials, 23% (370/1589) of subjects' virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions (any change from reference at NS5A amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93) identified by population or analysis of deep nucleotide sequences with a 15% frequency threshold.  In treatment-naïve subjects whose virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions in Studies ION-1 and ION-3, relapse rates were 6% (3/48) after 8 weeks and 1% (1/113) after 12 weeks of treatment with HARVONI. Relapse rates among subjects without baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions were 5% (8/167) after 8 weeks and 1% (3/306) after 12 weeks treatment with HARVONI.  In treatment-experienced subjects in Study ION-2 whose virus had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions, relapse rates were 22% (5/23) after 12 weeks and 0% (0/19) after 24 weeks of treatment with HARVONI. In another study in treatment-experienced subjects (SIRIUS), 0/15 (0%) subjects with NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions relapsed after 12 weeks of treatment with HARVONI + RBV compared to 2/15 (13%) subjects treated with 24 weeks of HARVONI.  SVR was achieved in all 24 subjects (N=20 with L159F+C316N; N=1 with L159F; and N=3 with N142T) who had baseline polymorphisms associated with resistance to sofosbuvir and/or other NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. The NS5B S282T substitution associated with resistance to sofosbuvir was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any subject in Phase 3 trials by population or deep nucleotide sequence analysis.  In the SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 trials (liver transplant recipients or subjects with decompensated liver disease), after 12 weeks of treatment with HARVONI and RBV, relapse rates were 7% (5/71) and 5% (10/217) in genotype 1 subjects with and without baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions, respectively.  In the Phase 3 trials and SOLAR trials, the specific baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms observed among subjects who relapsed were M28T/V, Q30H/R, L31M, H58D/P, and Y93H/N in genotype 1a, and L28M, L31M, A92T, and Y93H in genotype 1b. Subjects with multiple NS5A polymorphisms at resistance-associated positions appeared to have higher relapse rates.  Genotype 4, 5 or 6  Phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences from genotype 4-infected subjects in Study 1119 (N=44) and ION-4 (N=8) identified 7 HCV genotype 4 subtypes (4a, 4b, 4d, 4f, 4m, 4o, and 4r). Most subjects were infected with subtype 4a (N=32; 62%) or 4d (N=11; 21%); 1 to 3 subjects were infected with each of the other genotype 4 subtypes. There were 3 subjects with subtype 4r, 2 of whom experienced virologic relapse, and both had a combination of 2 pretreatment NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms (L28M/V+L30R).  Phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences from genotype 5-infected subjects in Study 1119 showed almost all were subtype 5a (N=39) with one subject not having a subtype identified at screening or by analysis.  Phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences from genotype 6-infected subjects in ELECTRON-2 identified 7 HCV genotype 6 subtypes (6a, 6e, 6l, 6m, 6p, 6q, and 6r). Thirty-two percent of the subjects had subtype 6a and 24% had subtype 6e. One to three subjects were infected with the other subtypes 6l, 6m, 6p, 6q, or 6r. The one subject who did not achieve SVR12 had subtype 6l.  Although the data are limited, baseline HCV NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms are not expected to impact the likelihood of achieving SVR when HARVONI is used as recommended to treat HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6-infected patients, based on the low virologic failure rate observed in Study 1119 and ELECTRON-2. The specific baseline polymorphisms observed in subjects with virologic failure were L28M/V, L30R, and P58T for genotype 4; L31M for genotype 5; and Q24K, F28V, R30A, and T58P for genotype 6.  Relapse occurred in 2 of 3 genotype 4 subjects who had baseline NS5B V321I, a polymorphism at a position associated with treatment failure to sofosbuvir and other nucleoside inhibitors; these two subjects also had baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms. For genotype 5 and 6, SVR12 was achieved in subjects who had baseline NS5B polymorphisms at positions associated with resistance to sofosbuvir and other nucleoside inhibitors (N=1 with N142T in genotype 5; N=1 with M289I in genotype 5; N=15 with M289L/I in genotype 6). The sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any subject with genotype 4, 5, or 6 HCV in clinical trials by population or deep nucleotide sequence analysis.  Pediatrics  In Study 1116, the presence of NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated polymorphisms did not impact treatment outcome; all pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with baseline NS5A or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor resistance-associated polymorphisms (18%; 17/96) achieved SVR following 12 weeks treatment with HARVONI.  Cross Resistance  Based on resistance patterns observed in cell culture replicon studies and HCV-infected subjects, cross-resistance between ledipasvir and other NS5A inhibitors is expected. Both sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of action, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. The efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has not been established in patients who have previously failed treatment with other regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor.</Section>
