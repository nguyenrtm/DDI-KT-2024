2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

 Ventavis is intended to be inhaled using the I-neb® AAD® System. Patients should receive 6 to 9 doses (inhalations) per day (minimum of 2 hours between doses during waking hours) as follows: 

 Starting dose: 2.5 mcg ( 2.1 ). 
 Uptitrate to 5 mcg if 2.5 mcg is well tolerated ( 2.1 ). 
 Maintenance dose: 5 mcg ( 2.1 ). 

 Delivered dose from ampule of : 

 Nebulizer 
 10 mcg/mL 
 20 mcg/mL 

 I-neb ® AAD ® 

 2.5 or 5 mcg from one ampule 
 5 mcg from one ampule 

 The 20 mcg/mL concentration is for patients who repeatedly experience extended treatment times ( 2.1 ). 
 Vital signs should be monitored while initiating Ventavis ( 2.2 ). 

 2.1 Recommended Dosing 

 Ventavis is intended to be inhaled using the I-neb® AAD® System. The first inhaled dose should be 2.5 mcg (as delivered at the mouthpiece). If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased to 5.0 mcg and maintained at that dose; otherwise maintain the dose at 2.5 mcg. Ventavis should be taken 6 to 9 times per day (no more than once every 2 hours) during waking hours, according to individual need and tolerability. The maximum daily dose evaluated in clinical studies was 45 mcg (5 mcg 9 times per day). 
 Direct mixing of Ventavis with other medications in the I-neb® AAD® System has not been evaluated; do not mix with other medications. To avoid potential interruptions in drug delivery due to equipment malfunctions, the patient should have easy access to a back-up I-neb®AAD® System. 
 Ventavis is supplied in 1 mL ampules in two concentrations: 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL. 

 Delivered dose from ampule of : 

 Nebulizer 
 10 mcg/mL 
 20 mcg/mL 

 I-neb ® AAD ® 

 2.5 or 5 mcg from one ampule 
 5 mcg from one ampule 

 The 20 mcg/mL concentration is intended for patients who are maintained at the 5 mcg dose and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing. Transitioning patients to the 20 mcg/mL concentration using the I-neb ® AAD ® System will decrease treatment times to help maintain patient compliance. 
 For each inhalation session, the entire contents of each opened ampule of Ventavis should be transferred into the I-neb® AAD® System medication chamber immediately before use [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ] . After each inhalation session, any solution remaining in the medication chamber should be discarded. Use of the remaining solution will result in unpredictable dosing. Patients should follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the I-neb® AAD® System components after each dose administration. 

 2.2 Monitoring 

 Vital signs should be monitored while initiating Ventavis. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 

 2.3 Use in Patients with Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment 

 Because iloprost elimination is reduced in patients with impaired liver function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] , consider increasing the dosing interval (e.g., 3-4 hours between doses depending on the patient's response at the end of the dose interval) in patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C hepatic impairment. 

 2.4 Use in Patients with Pre-existing Renal Impairment 

 Dose adjustment is not required in patients who are not on dialysis. The effect of dialysis on iloprost is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] .</Section>

5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 

 Ventavis solution should not be allowed to come into contact with the skin or eyes; oral ingestion of Ventavis solution should be avoided. 

 Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed. Ventavis should not be administered in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg ( 5.1 ). 
 Pulmonary venous hypertension: Discontinue if pulmonary edema is present ( 5.2 ). 
 May cause bronchospasm: Patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive ( 5.3 ). 

 5.1 Risk of Syncope 

 Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Do not initiate Ventavis in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Syncope can also occur in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, particularly in association with physical exertion. The occurrence of exertional syncope may reflect a therapeutic gap or insufficient efficacy, and the need to adjust dose or change therapy should be considered. 

 5.2 Pulmonary Venous Hypertension 

 Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled Ventavis is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, stop treatment immediately, as this may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension. 

 5.3 Bronchospasm 

 Ventavis inhalation can induce bronchospasm. Bronchospasm may be more severe or frequent in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways. Ventavis has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or with acute pulmonary infections.</Section>

7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 

 During clinical trials, iloprost was used concurrently with anticoagulants, diuretics, cardiac glycosides, calcium channel blockers, analgesics, antipyretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and other medications. Intravenous infusion of iloprost had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Acetylsalicylic acid did not alter the clearance (pharmacokinetics) of iloprost. 

 Ventavis has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and antihypertensive agents ( 7.2 ). 
 There is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients maintained on anticoagulants ( 7.3 ). 

 7.1 Cytochrome P450 

 Although clinical studies have not been conducted with Ventavis (inhaled iloprost), in vitro studies of iloprost indicate that no relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 drug metabolism would be expected. 

 7.2 Antihypertensives and Vasodilators 

 In studies in normal subjects, there was no pharmacodynamic interaction between intravenous iloprost and either nifedipine, diltiazem, or captopril. However, Ventavis has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and antihypertensive agents. 

 7.3 Anticoagulants and Platelet Inhibitors 

 Since Ventavis inhibits platelet function, there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients maintained on anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors.</Section>
