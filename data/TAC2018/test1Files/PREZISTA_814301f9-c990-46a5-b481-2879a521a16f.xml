2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Testing:  In treatment-experienced patients, treatment history genotypic and/or phenotypic testing is recommended prior to initiation of therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir to assess drug susceptibility of the HIV-1 virus ( 2.1 , 12.4 )  Monitor serum liver chemistry tests before and during therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 5.2 )  Treatment-naïve adult patients and treatment-experienced adult patients with no darunavir resistance associated substitutions: 800 mg (one 800 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food. ( 2.3 )  Treatment-experienced adult patients with at least one darunavir resistance associated substitution: 600 mg (one 600 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food. ( 2.3 )  Pregnant patients: 600 mg (one 600 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food. ( 2.4 )  Pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg): dosage of PREZISTA and ritonavir is based on body weight and should not exceed the adult dose. PREZISTA should be taken with ritonavir and with food. ( 2.5 )  PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.6 )  2.1 Testing Prior to Initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir  In treatment-experienced patients, treatment history, genotypic and/or phenotypic testing is recommended to assess drug susceptibility of the HIV-1 virus [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. Refer to Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.4) and (2.5) for dosing recommendations.  Appropriate laboratory testing such as serum liver biochemistries should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  2.2 Monitoring During Treatment with PREZISTA/ritonavir  Patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases should be monitored for elevation in serum liver biochemistries, especially during the first several months of PREZISTA/ritonavir treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients  PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer PREZISTA with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of darunavir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions.  Patients who have difficulty swallowing PREZISTA tablets can use the 100 mg per mL PREZISTA oral suspension.  Treatment-Naïve Adult Patients  The recommended oral dose of PREZISTA is 800 mg (one 800 mg tablet or 8 mL of the oral suspension) taken with ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet or capsule or 1.25 mL of a 80 mg per mL ritonavir oral solution) once daily and with food. An 8 mL PREZISTA dose should be taken as two 4 mL administrations with the included oral dosing syringe.  Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients  The recommended oral dosage for treatment-experienced adult patients is summarized in Table 1.  Baseline genotypic testing is recommended for dose selection. However, when genotypic testing is not feasible, PREZISTA 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is recommended.  Table 1: Recommended PREZISTA/ritonavir Dosage in Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients  Formulation and Recommended Dosing  Baseline Resistance  PREZISTA tablets with ritonavir tablets or capsule  PREZISTA oral suspension (100 mg/mL) with ritonavir oral solution (80 mg/mL)  With no darunavir resistance associated substitutions V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  One 800 mg PREZISTA tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet/capsule, taken once daily with food  8 mL An 8 mL darunavir dose should be taken as two 4 mL administrations with the included oral dosing syringe PREZISTA oral suspension with 1.25 mL ritonavir oral solution, taken once daily with food  With at least one darunavir resistance associated substitutions , or with no baseline resistance information  One 600 mg PREZISTA tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet/capsule, taken twice daily with food  6 mL PREZISTA oral suspension with 1.25 mL ritonavir oral solution, taken twice daily with food  2.4 Recommended Dosage During Pregnancy  The recommended dosage in pregnant patients is PREZISTA 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food.  PREZISTA 800 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily should only be considered in certain pregnant patients who are already on a stable PREZISTA 800 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily regimen prior to pregnancy, are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL), and in whom a change to twice daily PREZISTA 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may compromise tolerability or compliance.  2.5 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients (age 3 to less than 18 years)  Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate dose selection of PREZISTA, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instruction to minimize risk for medication errors, overdose, and underdose.  Prescribers should select the appropriate dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for each individual child based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended dose for adults.  Before prescribing PREZISTA, children weighing greater than or equal to 15 kg should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow a tablet, the use of PREZISTA oral suspension should be considered.  The recommended dose of PREZISTA/ritonavir for pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg is based on body weight (see Tables 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose. PREZISTA should be taken with ritonavir and with food.  The recommendations for the PREZISTA/ritonavir dosage regimens were based on pediatric clinical trial data and population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Dosing Recommendations for Treatment-Naïve Pediatric Patients or Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Pediatric Patients with No Darunavir Resistance Associated Substitutions  Pediatric patients weighing at least 10 kg but less than 15 kg  The weight-based dose in antiretroviral treatment-naïve pediatric patients or antiretroviral treatment-experienced pediatric patients with no darunavir resistance associated substitutions is PREZISTA 35 mg/kg once daily with ritonavir 7 mg/kg once daily using the following table:  Table 2: Recommended Dose for Pediatric Patients Weighing 10 kg to Less Than 15 kg Who are Treatment-Naïve or Treatment-Experienced with No Darunavir Resistance Associated Substitutions darunavir resistance associated substitutions: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  Body weight (kg)  Formulation: PREZISTA oral suspension (100 mg/mL) and ritonavir oral solution (80 mg/mL)  Dose: once daily with food  Greater than or equal to 10 kg to less than 11 kg  PREZISTA 3.6 mL The 350 mg, 385 mg, 455 mg and 490 mg darunavir dose for the specified weight groups were rounded up for suspension dosing convenience to 3.6 mL, 4 mL, 4.6 mL and 5 mL, respectively.

No data are available regarding the use of PREZISTA/ritonavir when co-administered to subjects with severe hepatic impairment; therefore, PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index). These drugs and other contraindicated drugs (which may lead to reduced efficacy of darunavir) are listed in Table 6 [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Due to the need for co-administration of PREZISTA with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for a description of ritonavir contraindications.  Table 6: Drugs That Are Contraindicated With PREZISTA/ritonavir  Drug class  Drugs within class that are contraindicated with PREZISTA/ritonavir  Clinical comment  Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist  alfuzosin  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as hypotension.  Antianginal  ranolazine  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions.  Antiarrhythmic  dronedarone  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Anti-gout  colchicine  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.  Antimycobacterial  rifampin  Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP450 metabolism. PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in combination with rifampin, as this may cause significant decreases in darunavir plasma concentrations. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect to PREZISTA.  Antipsychotics  lurasidone  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions.  pimozide  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Ergot derivatives  dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues.  GI motility agent  cisapride  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Sedative/hypnotics  Orally administered midazolam, triazolam  Triazolam and orally administered midazolam are extensively metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of triazolam or orally administered midazolam with PREZISTA/ritonavir may cause large increases in the concentrations of these benzodiazepines. Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression.  Herbal product  St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )  Patients taking PREZISTA/ritonavir should not use products containing St. John's wort because co-administration may result in reduced plasma concentrations of darunavir. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.  Hepatitis C direct-acting antiviral  elbasvir/grazoprevir  Potential for the increased risk of alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors  lovastatin, simvastatin  Potential for serious reactions such as myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. For dosing recommendation regarding atorvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin, see Table 11: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction.  PDE-5 inhibitor  sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  A safe and effective dose for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has not been established with PREZISTA/ritonavir. There is an increased potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which include visual disturbances, hypotension, prolonged erection, and syncope).  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index).

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. ( 5.2 )  Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. ( 5.3 )  Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. ( 5.4 )  Patients may develop new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. ( 5.6 )  Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat or immune reconstitution syndrome. ( 5.7 , 5.8 )  Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. ( 5.9 )  PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir up to days 23 to 26 of age. ( 5.10 )  5.1 Importance of Co-administration with Ritonavir  PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir and food to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Failure to administer PREZISTA with ritonavir and food may result in a loss of efficacy of darunavir.  Please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for additional information on precautionary measures.  5.2 Hepatotoxicity  Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N=3063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse events.  Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy has not been established.  Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZISTA/ritonavir treatment.  Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment.  5.3 Severe Skin Reactions  During the clinical development program (n=3063), severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, have been reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZISTA/ritonavir immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.  Rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in 10.3% of subjects treated with PREZISTA/ritonavir [ also see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Rash was mostly mild-to-moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. The discontinuation rate due to rash in subjects using PREZISTA/ritonavir was 0.5%.  Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing PREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to subjects receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.  5.4 Sulfa Allergy  Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. In clinical studies with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy.  5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PREZISTA/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:  Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.  Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PREZISTA/ritonavir.  Loss of therapeutic effect of PREZISTA/ritonavir and possible development of resistance.  See Table 11 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .  5.6 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between PI therapy and these events have not been established.  5.7 Fat Redistribution  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZISTA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment.  5.9 Hemophilia  There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established.  5.10 Not Recommended in Pediatric Patients Below 3 Years of Age  PREZISTA/ritonavir in pediatric patients below 3 years of age is not recommended in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with other drugs can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of darunavir. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7 , 12.3 )  7.1 Potential for PREZISTA/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs  PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-gp. Co-administration of PREZISTA and ritonavir with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6, or are transported by P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see Table 11 ).  7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Darunavir  Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolized by CYP3A. In vitro data indicate that darunavir may be a P-gp substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A, or P-gp may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (see Table 11 ).  7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Table 11 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with PREZISTA/ritonavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Table 11: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction (see Contraindications (4) for a complete list of contraindicated drugs) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) for Magnitude of Interaction, Tables 16 and 17 ]  Concomitant Drug Class Drug Name  Effect on Concentration of Darunavir Or Concomitant Drug  Clinical Comment  HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)  didanosine  ↔ darunavir ↔ didanosine  Didanosine should be administered one hour before or two hours after PREZISTA/ritonavir (which are administered with food).  HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: HIV-Protease Inhibitors (PIs)  indinavir  ↑ darunavir ↑ indinavir  The appropriate dose of indinavir in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir has not been established.  (The reference regimen for indinavir was indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily.)  lopinavir/ritonavir  ↓ darunavir ↔ lopinavir  Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer lopinavir/ritonavir and PREZISTA, with or without ritonavir.  saquinavir  ↓ darunavir ↔ saquinavir  Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer saquinavir and PREZISTA, with or without ritonavir.  Other HIV protease inhibitors, except atazanavir [see Drug Interactions(7.4) ]  As coadministration with PREZISTA/ritonavir has not been studied, coadministration is not recommended.  HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: CCR5 co-receptor antagonists  maraviroc  ↑ maraviroc  When used in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the dose of maraviroc should be 150 mg twice daily.  Other Agents  Antiarrhythmics :  For contraindicated antiarrhythmics, [see Contraindications (4) ] .  e.g. amiodarone, bepridil, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine (systemic), mexiletine, propafenone, quinidine  ↑ antiarrhythmics  Therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  digoxin  ↑ digoxin  The lowest dose of digoxin should initially be prescribed. The serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect.  Antibacterial : clarithromycin  ↔ darunavir ↑ clarithromycin  No dose adjustment of the combination is required for patients with normal renal function. For co-administration of clarithromycin and PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment, the following dose adjustments should be considered:  For subjects with CLcr of 30–60 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%.  For subjects with CLcr of &lt;30 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 75%.  Anticoagulants : apixaban  ↑ anticoagulant  Concomitant use of apixaban and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended.  dabigatran etexilate  The combination of PREZISTA/ritonavir and dabigatran etexilate is not recommended in specific renal impairment groups, depending on the indication. Please see the dabigatran US prescribing information for specific recommendations.  rivaroxaban  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and rivaroxaban is not recommended.  warfarin  ↓ warfarin ↔ darunavir  Warfarin concentrations are decreased when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir. It is recommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored when warfarin is combined with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine  ↔ darunavir ↑ carbamazepine  The dose of either PREZISTA/ritonavir or carbamazepine does not need to be adjusted when initiating co-administration with PREZISTA/ritonavir and carbamazepine. Clinical monitoring of carbamazepine concentrations and its dose titration is recommended to achieve the desired clinical response.  phenobarbital, phenytoin  ↔ darunavir ↓ phenytoin ↓ phenobarbital  Phenytoin and phenobarbital levels should be monitored when co-administering with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  Antidepressants :  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):  paroxetine, sertraline  ↓ paroxetine ↓ sertraline  If either sertraline or paroxetine is initiated in patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir, dose titrating the SSRI based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response is recommended. Monitor for antidepressant response in patients on a stable dose of sertraline or paroxetine who start treatment with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):  amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline  ↑ amitriptyline ↑ desipramine ↑ imipramine ↑ nortriptyline  Use a lower dose of the tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone due to potential increased adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope.  Other: trazodone  ↑ trazodone  Antifungals : itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole  ↑ darunavir ↑ itraconazole (not studied) ↑ ketoconazole ↔ posaconazole (not studied)  Monitor for increased PREZISTA/ritonavir adverse events with concomitant use of itraconazole, ketoconazole, or posaconazole. When co-administration is required, the daily dose of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg with monitoring for increased antifungal adverse events.  voriconazole  ↓ voriconazole (not studied)  Voriconazole is not recommended for patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir unless an assessment comparing predicted benefit to risk ratio justifies the use of voriconazole.  Anti-gout : colchicine  ↑ colchicine  The coadministration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]  .  For patients without renal or hepatic impairment:  Treatment of gout-flares – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir:  0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days.  Prophylaxis of gout-flares – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir:  If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.  Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir:  maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).  Antimalarial : artemether/lumefantrine  ↓ artemether ↓ dihydroartemisinin ↑ lumefantrine ↔ darunavir  The combination of PREZISTA/ritonavir and artemether/lumefantrine can be used without dose adjustments. However, the combination should be used with caution as increased lumefantrine exposure may increase the risk of QT prolongation.  Antimycobacterials :  For contraindicated antimycobacterials, [see Contraindications (4) ].  rifabutin  (The reference regimen for rifabutin was 300 mg once daily.)  ↑ darunavir ↑ rifabutin ↑ 25- O -desacetylrifabutin  Dose reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose (300 mg once daily) is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day). Increased monitoring for adverse events is warranted in patients receiving this combination and further dose reduction of rifabutin may be necessary.  rifapentine  ↓ darunavir  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with rifapentine is not recommended.  Antineoplastics:  dasatinib, nilotinib  ↑ antineoplastics  A decrease in the dosage or an adjustment of the dosing interval of dasatinib and nilotinib may be necessary for patients. Please refer to the dasatinib and nilotinib prescribing information for dosing instructions.  vinblastine, vincristine  For vincristine and vinblastine, consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when PREZISTA/ritonavir is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine. If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period, consideration should be given to initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor.  Antipsychotics :  For contraindicated antipsychotics, [see Contraindications (4) ].  quetiapine  ↑ quetiapine  Initiation of PREZISTA with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine:  Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.  Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking PREZISTA with ritonavir:  Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine.  e.g. risperidone, thioridazine  ↑ antipsychotics  A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  β-Blockers : e.g. carvedilol, metoprolol, timolol  ↑ beta-blockers  Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir and a lower dose of the beta blocker should be considered.  Calcium Channel Blockers : amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil  ↑ calcium channel blockers  Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended.  Systemic/Inhaled/ Nasal/Ophthalmic Corticosteroids: e.g.  betamethasone budesonide ciclesonide dexamethasone fluticasone methylprednisolone mometasone prednisone triamcinolone  ↓ darunavir ↑ corticosteroids  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with systemic dexamethasone or other systemic corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to darunavir. Consider alternative corticosteroids. Co-administration with corticosteroids of which exposures are significantly increased by strong CYP3A inhibitors can increase the risk for Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Alternative corticosteroids including beclomethasone and prednisolone (for which PK and/or PD are less affected by strong CYP3A inhibitors relative to other steroids) should be considered, particularly for long term use.  Endothelin receptor antagonist : bosentan  ↑ bosentan  Co-administration of bosentan in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir:  In patients who have been receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients on bosentan:  Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir. After at least 10 days following the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV):  Direct-Acting Antivirals:  For contraindicated HCV Direct-Acting Antivirals, [see Contraindications (4) ] .  simeprevir  ↑ simeprevir ↑ darunavir  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and simeprevir is not recommended  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors :  For contraindicated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, [see Contraindications (4) ].  atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin  ↑ HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors may lead to adverse events such as myopathy. Titrate atorvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose while monitoring for adverse events. Do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg/day.  Immunosuppressants : e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus  ↑ immunosuppressants  Therapeutic concentration monitoring of the immunosuppressive agent is recommended when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir.  Immunosuppressant/neoplastic:  everolimus  Co-administration of everolimus and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended.  Inhaled beta agonist : salmeterol  ↑ salmeterol  Co-administration of salmeterol and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  Narcotic analgesics/treatment of opioid dependence : buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone  ↔ buprenorphine, naloxone ↑ norbuprenorphine (metabolite)  No dose adjustment for buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone is required with concurrent administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir. Clinical monitoring is recommended if PREZISTA/ritonavir and buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone are coadministered.  methadone  ↓ methadone  No adjustment of methadone dosage is required when initiating co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as the dose of methadone during maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients.  Oral contraceptives/estrogen : ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone  ↓ ethinyl estradiol ↓ norethindrone  Effective alternative contraceptive method or barrier method of contraception is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] .  PDE-5 inhibitors : e.g. avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil  ↑ PDE-5 inhibitors (only the use of sildenafil at doses used for treatment of erectile dysfunction has been studied with PREZISTA/ritonavir)  Co-administration with PREZISTA/ritonavir may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances and priapism.  Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil with PREZISTA/ritonavir:  Co-administration of tadalafil in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir:  In patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir for at least one week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients on tadalafil:  Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting PREZISTA/ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction:  Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg dose in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg dose in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor-associated adverse events.  Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and avanafil is not recommended.  Proton pump inhibitor:  omeprazole  ↓ omeprazole ↔ darunavir  When omeprazole is co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir, monitor patients for decreased efficacy of omeprazole. Consider increasing the omeprazole dose in patients whose symptoms are not well controlled; avoid use of more than 40 mg per day of omeprazole.  Sedatives/hypnotics:  For contraindicated sedatives/hypnotics, [see Contraindications (4) ] .  metabolized by CYP3A e.g. buspirone, diazepam, estazolam, zoldipem  ↑ sedatives/hypnotics  Titration is recommended when co-administering PREZISTA/ritonavir with sedatives/hypnotics metabolized by CYP3A and a lower dose of the sedatives/hypnotics should be considered with monitoring for adverse events.  parenterally administered midazolam  Co-administration of parenteral midazolam should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.  7.4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with PREZISTA  No dosage adjustments are recommended when PREZISTA/ritonavir is co-administered with the following medications: atazanavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine), pitavastatin, raltegravir, ranitidine, or rilpivirine.</Section>
