<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  NORVIR oral solution is not recommended for use with polyurethane feeding tubes due to potential incompatibility. Feeding tubes composed of silicone or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can be used. (2.2)  Adult patients: 600 mg twice-day with meals (2.3)  Pediatrics patients: The recommended twice daily dose for children greater than one month of age is based on body surface area and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily with meals (2.4)  NORVIR oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother’s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 44 weeks has been attained (2.4 , 5.2)  NORVIR oral powder can only be used for dosing increments of 100 mg (2.4)  Instructions for Use should be followed for preparation and administration of NORVIR oral powder (2.5)  Dose modification for NORVIR is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors (2.6)  2.1 General Dosing and Administration Recommendations  NORVIR must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  NORVIR is administered orally. NORVIR tablets should be swallowed whole, and not chewed, broken or crushed. Take NORVIR with meals.  Patients may improve the taste of NORVIR oral solution by mixing with chocolate milk, Ensure ® , or Advera ® within one hour of dosing.  NORVIR oral powder should be mixed with soft food such as apple sauce or vanilla pudding, or mixed with liquid such as water, chocolate milk, or infant formula [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Instructions for Use ] . The bitter aftertaste of NORVIR oral powder may be lessened if administered with food.  General Dosing Guidelines  Patients who take the 600 mg twice daily soft gel capsule NORVIR dose may experience more gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea when switching from the soft gel capsule to the tablet formulation because of greater maximum plasma concentration (C max ) achieved with the tablet formulation relative to the soft gel capsule [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients should also be aware that these adverse events (gastrointestinal or paresthesias) may diminish as therapy is continued.  2.2 Administering Oral Solution by Feeding Tube  Because NORVIR oral solution contains ethanol and propylene glycol, it is not recommended for use with polyurethane feeding tubes due to potential incompatibility. Feeding tubes that are compatible with ethanol and propylene glycol, such as silicone and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) feeding tubes, can be used for administration of NORVIR oral solution. Follow instructions for use of the feeding tube to administer the medicine.  2.3 Recommended Adult Dosage  Recommended Dosage for Treatment of HIV-1:  The recommended dosage of NORVIR is 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals. Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment-emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels. NORVIR should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily. The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] .  Pregnant Women  NORVIR oral solution is not recommended during pregnancy due to its ethanol content. NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .  2.4 Recommended Pediatric Dosage  NORVIR must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . The recommended dosage of NORVIR in pediatric patients older than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m 2 twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. NORVIR should be started at 250 mg per m 2 twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m 2 twice daily. If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m 2 twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] .  Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Solution  NORVIR oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother’s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 44 weeks has been attained [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v). Special attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of NORVIR, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors, and overdose. This is especially important for young children. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to pediatric patients 1 to 6 months of age should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  and Overdosage (10) ] . When possible, dose should be administered using a calibrated dosing syringe.  Table 1.

Body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows 1 :  Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Powder  NORVIR oral powder should be used only for dosing increments of 100 mg. NORVIR powder should not be used for doses less than 100 mg or for incremental doses between 100 mg intervals. NORVIR oral solution is the preferred formulation for patients requiring doses less than 100 mg or incremental doses between 100 mg intervals.  norvir equation  2.5 Preparation of Norvir Oral Powder  For details on the preparation and administration of NORVIR oral powder (see  Instructions for Use  ). NORVIR oral powder should only be used for dosing increments of 100 mg.  Prepare the dose using the required number of packets. For example, use one packet for doses of 100 mg and two packets for doses of 200 mg. Pour and mix the entire contents of each packet over soft food or liquid. All of the powder mixed with soft food or liquid should be administered within 2 hours of preparation. If not administered within 2 hours of preparation, the mixture should be discarded and a new dose prepared.  The prescribed dose of NORVIR oral powder can be administered via a feeding tube after being mixed with water (see  Instructions for Use  ). Follow the instructions for the feeding tube to administer the medicine.  2.6 Dose Modification due to Drug Interaction  Dose reduction of NORVIR is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir .  Prescribers should consult the full prescribing information and clinical study information of these protease inhibitors if they are co-administered with a reduced dose of ritonavir  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and Drug Interactions (7) ] .</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  The following have been observed in patients receiving NORVIR:  The concomitant use of NORVIR and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (5.1 , 7.2)  Toxicity in preterm neonates: NORVIR oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. A safe and effective dose of NORVIR oral solution in this patient population has not been established (2.4,  5.2)  Hepatotoxicity: Fatalities have occurred. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, or marked transaminase elevations (5.3, 8.6)  Pancreatitis: Fatalities have occurred; suspend therapy as clinically appropriate (5.4)  Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions have been reported and include anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bronchospasm and angioedema. Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop (5.5, 6.2)  PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients. Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported. Use with caution with patients with preexisting conduction system disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, underlying structural heart disease or when administering with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval (5.6, 12.3)  Total cholesterol and triglycerides elevations: Monitor prior to therapy and periodically thereafter (5.7)  Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia (5.8)  Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome (5.9)  Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.10)  Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additional factor VIII may be required (5.11)  5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of NORVIR, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving NORVIR, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of NORVIR, respectively. These interactions may lead to:  Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.  Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of NORVIR.  Loss of therapeutic effect of NORVIR and possible development of resistance.  When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors, see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important Warnings and Precautions.  See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during NORVIR therapy; review concomitant medications during NORVIR therapy, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .  5.2 Toxicity in Preterm Neonates  NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v) . When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations. Preterm neonates may be at an increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events. Postmarketing life-threatening cases of cardiac toxicity (including complete AV block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates receiving lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution which also contains the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol.  NORVIR oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. However, if the benefit of using NORVIR oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks, infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to NORVIR oral solution including: hyperosmolality, with or without lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, CNS depression (including stupor, coma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes, and hemolysis. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and Overdosage (10) ] .  5.3 Hepatotoxicity  Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving NORVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Table 4). There may be an increased risk for transaminase elevations in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering NORVIR to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in these patients, especially during the first three months of NORVIR treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .  There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients taking multiple concomitant medications and/or with advanced AIDS.  5.4 Pancreatitis  Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving NORVIR therapy, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and NORVIR therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made.  5.5 Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivity  Allergic reactions including urticaria, mild skin eruptions, bronchospasm, and angioedema have been reported. Cases of anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop.  5.6 PR Interval Prolongation  Ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Post marketing cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients.  NORVIR should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease, preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities.  The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended [see Drug Interactions (7)  and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  5.7 Lipid Disorders  Treatment with NORVIR therapy alone or in combination with saquinavir has resulted in substantial increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating NORVIR therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate, taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions with NORVIR and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors [see Contraindications (4)  and Drug Interactions (7) ] .  5.8 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with NORVIR.  5.9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including NORVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  5.10 Fat Redistribution  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.11 Patients with Hemophilia  There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.  5.12 Resistance/Cross-resistance  Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Continued administration of ritonavir 600 mg twice daily following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors [see Microbiology (12.4) ] .  5.13 Laboratory Tests  Ritonavir has been shown to increase triglycerides, cholesterol, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), GGT, CPK, and uric acid. Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed prior to initiating NORVIR therapy and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms occur during therapy.</Section>

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  See also Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir), see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important information for drug interactions.  Co-administration of NORVIR can alter the concentrations of other drugs. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy (4 , 5.1 , 7 , 12.3)  7.1 Potential for NORVIR to Affect Other Drugs  Ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (greater than 3-fold) when co-administered with ritonavir. Thus, co-administration of NORVIR with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 5.  Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Co-administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases (up to 2-fold) in the AUC of the other agent, possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.  7.2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Table 5 provides a list of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. Alteration in dose or regimen may be recommended based on drug interaction studies or predicted interaction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  for magnitude of interaction.  Table 5. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Concomitant Drug Class:  Drug Name  Effect on Concentration of Ritonavir or Concomitant Drug  Clinical Comment  HIV-Antiviral Agents  HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor: atazanavir darunavir fosamprenavir  ↑ amprenavir ↑ atazanavir ↑ darunavir  See the complete prescribing information for fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir for details on co-administration with ritonavir.  HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor: indinavir  ↑ indinavir  Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established.  HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor: saquinavir  ↑ saquinavir  See the complete prescribing information for saquinavir for details on co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir. Saquinavir/ritonavir in combination with rifampin is not recommended due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three drugs are given together.  HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor: tipranavir  ↑ tipranavir  See the complete prescribing information for tipranavir for details on co-administration of tipranavir and ritonavir.  Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor: delavirdine  ↑ ritonavir  Appropriate doses of this combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established.  HIV-1 CCR5 – antagonist: maraviroc  ↑ maraviroc  See the complete prescribing information for maraviroc for details on co-administration of maraviroc and ritonavir-containing protease inhibitors.  Integrase Inhibitor: raltegravir  ↓ raltegravir  The effects of ritonavir on raltegravir with ritonavir dosage regimens greater than 100 mg twice daily have not been evaluated, however raltegravir concentrations may be decreased with ritonavir coadministration.  Other Agents  Analgesics, Narcotic: tramadol, propoxyphene, methadone, fentanyl  ↑ analgesics  ↓ methadone  ↑ fentanyl  A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Dosage increase of methadone may be considered.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects (including potentially fatal respiratory depression) is recommended when fentanyl is concomitantly administered with NORVIR.  Anesthetic: meperidine  ↓ meperidine/ ↑ normeperidine (metabolite)  Dosage increase and long-term use of meperidine with ritonavir are not recommended due to the increased concentrations of the metabolite normeperidine which has both analgesic activity and CNS stimulant activity (e.g., seizures).  Antialcoholics: disulfiram/ metronidazole  Ritonavir formulations contain ethanol, which can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other drugs that produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole).  Antiarrhythmics: disopyramide, lidocaine, mexiletine  ↑ antiarrhythmics  For contraindicated antiarrhythmics [see Contraindications (4) ] . Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered with ritonavir, if available.  Anticancer Agents: dasatinib, nilotinib, venetoclax, vincristine, vinblastine  ↑ anticancer agents  For vincristine and vinblastine, consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when ritonavir is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine. Clinicians should be aware that if the ritonavir containing regimen is withheld for a prolonged period, consideration should be given to altering the regimen to not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor in order to control HIV-1 viral load. A decrease in the dosage or an adjustment of the dosing interval of nilotinib and dasatinib may be necessary for patients requiring co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as NORVIR. Please refer to the nilotinib and dasatinib prescribing information for dosing instructions.  Coadministration of venetoclax and NORVIR may increase the risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Refer to the venetoclax prescribing information for dosing instructions.  Anticoagulant: warfarin  ↑↓ warfarin  Initial frequent monitoring of the INR during ritonavir and warfarin co-administration is recommended.  Anticoagulant: rivaroxaban  ↑ rivaroxaban  Avoid concomitant use of rivaroxaban and ritonavir. Co-administration of ritonavir and rivaroxaban may lead to risk of increased bleeding.  Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide  ↑ anticonvulsants  A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for these anticonvulsants, if available.  Anticonvulsants: divalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin  ↓ anticonvulsants  A dose increase may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for these anticonvulsants, if available.  Antidepressants: nefazodone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, tricyclics: e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline  ↑ antidepressants  A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Antidepressant: bupropion  ↓ bupropion ↓ active metabolite, hydroxybupropion  Patients receiving ritonavir and bupropion concurrently should be monitored for an adequate clinical response to bupropion.  Antidepressant: desipramine  ↑ desipramine  Dosage reduction and concentration monitoring of desipramine is recommended.  Antidepressant: trazodone  ↑ trazodone  Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed following co-administration of trazodone and NORVIR. A lower dose of trazodone should be considered.  Antiemetic: dronabinol  ↑ dronabinol  A dose decrease of dronabinol may be needed when co-administered with ritonavir.  Antifungals: ketoconazole itraconazole voriconazole  ↑ ketoconazole ↑ itraconazole ↓ voriconazole  For contraindicated antifungals, [see Contraindications (4) ] .  High doses of ketoconazole or itraconazole (greater than 200 mg per day) are not recommended.  Co-administration of voriconazole and ritonavir doses of 400 mg every 12 hours or greater is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Co-administration of voriconazole and ritonavir 100 mg should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole.  Anti-gout: colchicine  ↑ colchicine  Concomitant administration with colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) ] .  For patients with normal renal or hepatic function:  Treatment of gout flares-co-administration of colchicine in patients on ritonavir:  0.6 mg (one tablet) for one dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) one hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than three days.  Prophylaxis of gout flares-co-administration of colchicine in patients on ritonavir:  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day.  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.  Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-co-administration of colchicine in patients on ritonavir:  Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).  Anti-infective: clarithromycin  ↑ clarithromycin  For patients with renal impairment, adjust clarithromycin dose as follows:  For patients with CL CR 30 to 60 mL per min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%.  For patients with CL CR less than 30 mL per min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%.  No dose adjustment for patients with normal renal function is necessary.  Antimycobacterial: bedaquiline  ↑ bedaquiline  Bedaquiline should only be used with ritonavir if the benefit of co-administration outweighs the risk.  Antimycobacterial: rifabutin  ↑ rifabutin and rifabutin metabolite  Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least three-quarters of the usual dose of 300 mg per day is recommended (e.g., 150 mg every other day or three times a week). Further dosage reduction may be necessary.  Antimycobacterial: rifampin  ↓ ritonavir  May lead to loss of virologic response. Alternate antimycobacterial agents such as rifabutin should be considered.  Antiparasitic: atovaquone  ↓ atovaquone  Clinical significance is unknown; however, increase in atovaquone dose may be needed.  Antiparasitic: quinine  ↑ quinine  A dose decrease of quinine may be needed when co-administered with ritonavir.  Antipsychotics: perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine  ↑ antipsychotics  For contraindicated antipsychotics, [see Contraindications (4) ] . A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Antipsychotics: quetiapine  ↑ quetiapine  Initiation of NORVIR in patients taking quetiapine:  Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.  Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking NORVIR:  Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine.  β-Blockers: metoprolol, timolol  ↑ beta-blockers  Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Bronchodilator: theophylline  ↓ theophylline  Increased dosage of theophylline may be required; therapeutic monitoring should be considered.  Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil  ↑ calcium channel blockers  Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Digoxin  ↑ digoxin  Concomitant administration of ritonavir with digoxin may increase digoxin levels. Caution should be exercised when co-administering ritonavir with digoxin, with appropriate monitoring of serum digoxin levels.  Endothelin receptor antagonists: bosentan  ↑ bosentan  Co-administration of bosentan in patients on ritonavir:  In patients who have been receiving ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Co-administration of ritonavir in patients on bosentan:  Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of ritonavir.  After at least 10 days following the initiation of ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Hepatitis C direct acting antiviral: simeprevir  ↑simeprevir  It is not recommended to co-administer ritonavir with simeprevir.  HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor: atorvastatin rosuvastatin  ↑ atorvastatin  ↑ rosuvastatin  For contraindicated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, [see Contraindications (4) ] . Titrate atorvastatin and rosuvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose. If NORVIR is used with another protease inhibitor, see the complete prescribing information for the concomitant protease inhibitor for details on co-administration with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.  Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (rapamycin)  ↑ immunosuppressants  Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant agents when co-administered with ritonavir.  Systemic/Inhaled/ Nasal/Ophthalmic Corticosteroids: e.g., betamethasone budesonide ciclesonide dexamethasone fluticasone methylprednisolone mometasone prednisone triamcinolone  ↑ glucocorticoids  Coadministration with corticosteroids whose exposures are significantly increased by strong CYP3A inhibitors can increase the risk for Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.  Alternative corticosteroids including beclomethasone and prednisolone (whose PK and/or PD are less affected by strong CYP3A inhibitors relative to other studied steroids) should be considered, particularly for long-term use.  Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist: salmeterol  ↑ salmeterol  Concurrent administration of salmeterol and ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  Oral Contraceptives or Patch Contraceptives: ethinyl estradiol  ↓ ethinyl estradiol  Alternate methods of contraception should be considered.  PDE5 Inhibitors: avanafil sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil  ↑ avanafil ↑ sildenafil ↑ tadalafil ↑ vardenafil  For contraindicated PDE5 inhibitors, [see Contraindications (4) ] . Do not use ritonavir with avanafil because a safe and effective avanafil dosage regimen has not been established.  Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil in patients receiving ritonavir. Coadministration of ritonavir with these drugs may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual changes, and prolonged erection.  Use of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):  Sildenafil (Revatio ® ) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil (Adcirca ® ) with ritonavir:  Co-administration of ADCIRCA in patients on ritonavir:  In patients receiving ritonavir for at least one week, start ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Co-administration of ritonavir in patients on ADCIRCA:  Avoid use of ADCIRCA during the initiation of ritonavir. Stop ADCIRCA at least 24 hours prior to starting ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of ritonavir, resume ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Use of PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction:  It is recommended not to exceed the following doses:  Sildenafil: 25 mg every 48 hours  Tadalafil: 10 mg every 72 hours  Vardenafil: 2.5 mg every 72 hours  Use with increased monitoring for adverse events.  Sedative/hypnotics: buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, zolpidem  ↑ sedative/hypnotics  A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with ritonavir.  Sedative/hypnotics: Parenteral midazolam  ↑ midazolam  For contraindicated sedative/hypnotics, [see Contraindications (4) ] . Co-administration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.  Stimulant: methamphetamine  ↑ methamphetamine  Use with caution. A dose decrease of methamphetamine may be needed when co-administered with ritonavir.</Section>
