<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  APTIVUS must be co-administered with ritonavir to exertits therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer APTIVUSwith ritonavir will result in plasma levels of tipranavir that willbe insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will altersome drug interactions.  APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir capsules or solutioncan be taken with or without meals  APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir tablets must onlybe taken with meals  [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  APTIVUS may be administered as either capsules or oralsolution to either pediatric or adult patients.  Due to the need for co-administration of APTIVUS withritonavir, please refer to the ritonavir prescribing information.  Adults: 500 mg APTIVUS, co-administered with 200 mg ritonavir,twice daily (2.1)  Pediatric patients (age 2 to 18 years): Dosing is basedon body weight or body surface area not to exceed adult dose (2.2)  APTIVUS taken with ritonavir  capsules orsolution  can be taken with or without meals (2)  APTIVUS taken with ritonavir  tablets  must be taken with meals (2)  Store unopened bottles of APTIVUS capsules in the refrigerator (16)  Do not freeze or refrigerate APTIVUS oral solution (16)  2.1  Adults  The recommended adult dose of APTIVUS is500 mg (two 250 mg capsules or 5 mL oral solution) co-administeredwith 200 mg of ritonavir, twice daily.  2.2  Pediatric Patients(age 2 to 18 years)  Healthcareprofessionals should pay special attention to accurate calculationof the dose of APTIVUS, transcription of the medication order, dispensinginformation and dosing instruction to minimize risk for medicationerrors, overdose, and underdose.  Prescribers should calculate the appropriate dose of APTIVUS foreach individual child based on body weight (kg) or body surface area(BSA, m 2 ) and should not exceed the recommendedadult dose.  Before prescribingAPTIVUS 250 mg capsules, children should be assessed for the abilityto swallow capsules. If a child is unable to reliably swallow an APTIVUScapsule, the APTIVUS oral solution formulation should be prescribed.  The recommended pediatric dose of APTIVUSis 14 mg/kg with 6 mg/kg ritonavir (or 375 mg/m 2 co-administered with ritonavir 150 mg/m 2 ) taken twice daily not to exceed a maximum dose of APTIVUS 500 mgco-administered with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. For children whodevelop intolerance or toxicity and cannot continue with APTIVUS 14mg/kg with 6 mg/kg ritonavir, physicians may consider decreasing thedose to APTIVUS 12 mg/kg with 5 mg/kg ritonavir (or APTIVUS 290 mg/m 2 co-administered with 115 mg/m 2 ritonavir) taken twice daily provided their virus is not resistantto multiple protease inhibitors [  see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , and Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  Body surface area can be calculated as follows:  aptivus-formula</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Please refer to the ritonavir prescribing informationfor additional information on precautionary measures.  Hepatic Impairment: Discontinue for signs and symptoms ofclinical hepatitis or asymptomatic increases in ALT/AST &gt;10 timesULN or asymptomatic increases in ALT/AST 5-10 times ULN with concomitantincreases in total bilirubin. Monitor liver function tests prior totherapy and frequently thereafter. (5.1)  Intracranial Hemorrhage/Platelet Aggregation and Coagulation:Use with caution in patients at risk for increased bleeding or whoare receiving medications that increase the risk of bleeding (5.2 , 5.4)  The concomitant use of APTIVUS/ritonavir and certain otherdrugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatmentfor potential drug interactions. (5.3,  7.2)  Rash: Discontinue and initiate appropriate treatment ifsevere skin reaction occurs or is suspected. (5.6) Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamideallergy. (5.7)  Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetesmellitus, hyperglycemia (5.8) , immunereconstitution syndrome (5.9) , redistribution/accumulationof body fat (5.10) , and elevatedlipids. (5.11) Monitor cholesteroland triglycerides prior to therapy and periodically thereafter.  Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additionalfactor VIII may be required (5.12)  5.1  Hepatic Impairmentand Toxicity  Clinicalhepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities, werereported with APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir. Thesehave generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease takingmultiple concomitant medications. A causal relationship to APTIVUS/ritonavircould not be established. Physicians and patients should be vigilantfor the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue,malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools,liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. Patients with signs or symptomsof clinical hepatitis should discontinue APTIVUS/ritonavir treatmentand seek medical evaluation.  Allpatients should be followed closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring,especially those with chronic hepatitis B or C co-infection, as thesepatients have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Liver functiontests should be performed prior to initiating therapy with APTIVUS/ritonavir,and frequently throughout the duration of treatment.  If asymptomatic elevations in AST or ALT greater than10 times the upper limit of normal occur, APTIVUS/ritonavir therapyshould be discontinued. If asymptomatic elevations in AST or ALT between5 – 10 times the upper limit of normal and increases in total bilirubingreater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal occur, APTIVUS/ritonavirtherapy should be discontinued.  Treatment-experienced patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitisC co-infection or elevated transaminases are at approximately 2-foldrisk for developing Grade 3 or 4 transaminase elevations or hepaticdecompensation. In two large, randomized, open-label, controlled clinicaltrials with an active comparator (1182.12 and 1182.48) of treatment-experiencedpatients, Grade 3 and 4 increases in hepatic transaminases were observedin 10.3% (10.9/100 PEY) receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir through week 48.In a study of treatment-naïve patients, 20.3% (21/100 PEY) experiencedGrade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevations while receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir500 mg/200 mg through week 48.  Tipranavir is principally metabolized by the liver. Caution shouldbe exercised when administering APTIVUS/ritonavir to patients withmild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) because tipranavir concentrationsmay be increased [  see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  5.2  Intracranial Hemorrhage  APTIVUS, co-administered with 200 mg ofritonavir, has been associated with reports of both fatal and non-fatalintracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Many of these patients had other medicalconditions or were receiving concomitant medications that may havecaused or contributed to these events. No pattern of abnormal coagulationparameters has been observed in patients in general, or precedingthe development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of coagulationparameters is not currently indicated in the management of patientson APTIVUS.  5.3  Risk of SeriousAdverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir, a CYP3Ainhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3Aor initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients alreadyreceiving APTIVUS/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations ofmedications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibitor induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of APTIVUS/ritonavir,respectively. These interactions may lead to:  Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leadingto severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposuresof concomitant medications.  Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposuresof APTIVUS/ritonavir.  Loss of therapeutic effect of APTIVUS/ritonavir and possibledevelopment of resistance.  See Table 4 for steps toprevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions,including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Consider the potential fordrug interactions prior to and during APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy; reviewconcomitant medications during APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy; and monitorfor the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and DrugInteractions (7) ] .  5.4  Effects on Platelet Aggregation and Coagulation  APTIVUS/ritonavir should be used with cautionin patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma,surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving medicationsknown to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agentsand anticoagulants, or who are taking supplemental high doses of vitaminE.  In rats, tipranavir treatmentalone induced dose-dependent changes in coagulation parameters, bleedingevents and death. Co-administration with vitamin E significantly increasedthese effects [  see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)  ]. However, analysesof stored plasma from adult patients treated with APTIVUS capsulesand pediatric patients treated with APTIVUS oral solution (which containsa vitamin E derivative) showed no effect of APTIVUS/ritonavir on vitaminK-dependent coagulation factors (Factor II and Factor VII), FactorV, or on prothrombin or activated partial thromboplastin times.  In  in vitro  experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human plateletaggregation at levels consistent with exposures observed in patientsreceiving APTIVUS/ritonavir.  5.5  Vitamin E Intake  Patients taking APTIVUS oral solution shouldbe advised not to take supplemental vitamin E greater than a standardmultivitamin as APTIVUS oral solution contains 116 IU/mL of vitaminE which is higher than the Reference Daily Intake (adults 30 IU, pediatricsapproximately 10 IU).  5.6  Rash  Rash, including urticarial rash, maculopapularrash, and possible photosensitivity, has been reported in subjectsreceiving APTIVUS/ritonavir. In some cases rash was accompanied byjoint pain or stiffness, throat tightness, or generalized pruritus.In controlled adult clinical trials, rash (all grades, all causality)was observed in 10% of females and in 8% of males receiving APTIVUS/ritonavirthrough 48 weeks of treatment. The median time to onset of rash was53 days and the median duration of rash was 22 days. The discontinuationrate for rash in clinical trials was 0.5%. In an uncontrolled compassionateuse program (n=3920), cases of rash, some of which were severe, accompaniedby myalgia, fever, erythema, desquamation, and mucosal erosions werereported. In the pediatric clinical trial, the frequency of rash (allgrades, all causality) through 48 weeks of treatment was 21%. Overall,most of the pediatric patients had mild rash and 5 (5%) had moderaterash. Overall 3% of pediatric patients interrupted APTIVUS treatmentdue to rash and the discontinuation rate for rash in pediatric patientswas 0.9%. Discontinue and initiate appropriate treatment if severeskin rash develops.  5.7  Sulfa Allergy  APTIVUS should be used with caution in patientswith a known sulfonamide allergy. Tipranavir contains a sulfonamidemoiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamideclass and APTIVUS is unknown.  5.8  Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbationof pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reportedduring post-marketing surveillance in HIV-1 infected patients receivingprotease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiationor dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatmentof these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred.In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemiapersisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarilyduring clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made anda causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and theseevents has not been established.  5.9  Immune ReconstitutionSyndrome  Immune reconstitutionsyndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviraltherapy, including APTIVUS. During the initial phase of combinationantiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds maydevelop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunisticinfections (such as  Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus,  Pneumocystisjiroveci  pneumonia, tuberculosis, or reactivationof herpes simplex and herpes zoster), which may necessitate furtherevaluation and treatment.  Autoimmunedisorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barrésyndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immunereconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and canoccur many months after initiation of treatment.  5.10 Fat Redistribution  Redistribution/accumulation of body fatincluding central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalohump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and"cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviraltherapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these eventsare currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.11 Elevated Lipids  Treatment with APTIVUS co-administered with200 mg of ritonavir has resulted in large increases in the concentrationof total cholesterol and triglycerides [  see AdverseReactions (6)  ].Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior toinitiating APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals duringtherapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate;taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions [  see Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  5.12 Patients with Hemophilia  There have been reports of increased bleeding,including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patientswith hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. Insome patients additional Factor VIII was given. In more than halfof the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continuedor reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationshipbetween protease inhibitors and these events has not been established.  5.13 Resistance/CrossResistance  Because thepotential for HIV-1 cross-resistance among protease inhibitors hasnot been fully explored in APTIVUS/ritonavir treated patients, itis unknown what effect therapy with APTIVUS will have on the activityof subsequently administered protease inhibitors.</Section>

7  DRUG INTERACTIONS  See also  Contraindications (4.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  .  Co-administration of APTIVUS can alter theconcentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrationof tipranavir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be consideredprior to and during therapy. (4.2 , 5.3 , 7)  7.1  Potential for APTIVUS/ritonavirto Affect Other Drugs  APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir at the recommended dose isa net inhibitor of CYP 3A and may increase plasma concentrations ofagents that are primarily metabolized by CYP 3A. Thus, co-administrationof APTIVUS/ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP 3A for clearanceand for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with seriousand/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [  see Contraindications (4.2)  ]. Co-administration with other CYP 3A substrates may requirea dose adjustment or additional monitoring [  seeDrug Interactions (7)  ].  Clinically significant drug-druginteractions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir are summarizedin Table 4 below.  A phenotypiccocktail study was conducted with 16 healthy volunteers to quantifythe influence of 10 days of APTIVUS/ritonavir capsule administrationon the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19(omeprazole), 2D6 (dextromethorphan) and the activity of intestinaland hepatic CYP 3A4/5 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin).This study determined the first-dose and steady-state effects of 500mg of APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir twice dailyin capsule form. APTIVUS oral solution co-administered with ritonavircapsules demonstrated similar effects as APTIVUS capsules co-administratedwith ritonavir.  There was nonet effect on CYP 2C9 or hepatic P-gp at first dose or steady state.There was no net effect after first dose on CYP 1A2, but there wasmoderate induction at steady state. There was modest inhibition ofCYP 2C19 at the first dose, but there was marked induction at steadystate. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinalCYP 3A4/5 activities were observed after first dose and steady state.  Intestinal and hepatic P-gp activity wasassessed by administering oral and intravenous digoxin, respectively.The digoxin results indicate P-gp was inhibited after the first doseof APTIVUS/ritonavir followed by induction of P-gp over time. Thus,it is difficult to predict the net effect of APTIVUS administeredwith ritonavir on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations ofdrugs that are dual substrates of CYP 3A and P-gp. The net effectwill vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administereddrugs for CYP 3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-passmetabolism/efflux. An  in vitro  induction study in human hepatocytes showed an increase in UGT1A1by tipranavir similar to that evoked by rifampin. The clinical consequencesof this finding have not been established.  7.2  Potential for OtherDrugs to Affect Tipranavir  Tipranavir is a CYP 3A substrate and a P-gp substrate.Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that induce CYP 3Aand/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir plasma concentrations. Co-administrationof APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavirplasma concentrations. Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir withdrugs that inhibit CYP 3A may not further increase tipranavir plasmaconcentrations, because the level of metabolites is low followingsteady-state administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir 500/200 mg twicedaily.  Clinically significantdrug-drug interactions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir aresummarized in Table 4 below.  Table 4      Established and OtherPotentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose orRegimen May be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or PredictedInteraction  ↑ increase, ↓ decrease, ↔ no change,↕ unable to predict  Concomitant Drug Class: Drug name  Effect onConcentration of Tipranavir or Concomitant Drug  Clinical Comment  HIV-1 AntiviralAgents  Fusion Inhibitors:  Enfuvirtide  ↑ Tipranavir  At steady state, tipranavir trough concentrationswere approximately 45% higher in patients co-administered enfuvirtidein the Phase 3 trials. The mechanism for this increase is not known. Dose adjustments are not recommended.  Non-NucleosideReverse Transcriptase  Inhibitors:  Etravirine  ↓ Etravirine  APTIVUS/ritonavir when coadministered with etravirinemay cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of etravirineand loss of therapeutic effect of etravirine. Etravirine and APTIVUS/ritonavirshould not be coadministered.  Rilpivirine  The use of rilpivirine co-administered with APTIVUS/ritonavirhas not been studied.  Concomitant use of rilpivirine with Aptivus/ritonavir may causean increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibitionof CYP3A enzymes). Rilpivirine is not expected to affect the plasmaconcentrations of Aptivus/ritonavir.  Nucleoside ReverseTranscriptase  Inhibitors:  Abacavir  ↓ Abacavir AUC by approximately 40%  Clinical relevance of reduction in abacavir levelsnot established. Dose adjustment of abacavir cannot be recommendedat this time.  Didanosine (EC)  ↓ Didanosine  Clinical relevance of reduction in didanosine levels not established.For optimal absorption, didanosine should be separated from APTIVUS/ritonavirdosing by at least 2 hours.  Zidovudine  ↓ Zidovudine AUC by approximately 35%. ZDV glucuronideconcentrations were unaltered.  Clinical relevance of reduction in zidovudine levels not established.Dose adjustment of zidovudine cannot be recommended at this time.  Protease Inhibitors (co-administeredwith 200 mg of ritonavir):  Fosamprenavir Lopinavir Saquinavir  ↓ Amprenavir ↓ Lopinavir ↓Saquinavir  Combining a protease inhibitor with APTIVUS/ritonaviris not recommended.  Protease Inhibitors (co-administeredwith 100 mg of ritonavir):  Atazanavir  ↓ Atazanavir ↑ Tipranavir  Virus Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors:  Raltegravir  ↓ Raltegravir  APTIVUS/ritonavir reduces plasmaconcentrations of raltegravir. Since comparable efficacy was observedfor this combination in phase 3 studies, dose adjustment is not recommended.  Agents for Opportunistic Infections  Antifungals:  Fluconazole Itraconazole Ketoconazole Voriconazole  ↑ Tipranavir, ↔ Fluconazole  Fluconazole increases tipranavir concentrations butdose adjustments are not needed. Fluconazole doses &gt;200 mg/day arenot recommended.  ↑ Itraconazole (not studied)  ↑ Ketoconazole (not studied)  Based on theoretical considerations itraconazoleand ketoconazole should be used with caution. High doses (&gt;200 mg/day)are not recommended.  ↕ Voriconazole (not studied)  Due to multiple enzymes involvedwith voriconazole metabolism, it is difficult to predict the interaction.  Antimycobacterials:  Clarithromycin  ↑ Tipranavir, ↑ Clarithromycin, ↓ 14-hydroxy-clarithromycinmetabolite  No dose adjustment of APTIVUS or clarithromycin forpatients with normal renal function is necessary.    For patients with renal impairment the following dosage adjustmentsshould be considered:  For patients with CL CR 30 to 60 mL/minthe dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%.  For patients with CL CR &lt;30 mL/minthe dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%.  Rifabutin  Tipranavir not changed, ↑ Rifabutin ↑ Desacetyl-rifabutin  Single dose study. Dosage reductions of rifabutin by 75% are recommended(e.g., 150 mg every other day). Increased monitoring for adverse eventsin patients receiving the combination is warranted. Further dosagereduction may be necessary.    Other AgentsCommonly Used  Anticonvulsants:  Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin  ↓ Tipranavir  Caution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine,phenobarbital and/or phenytoin. APTIVUS may be less effective dueto decreased tipranavir plasma concentration in patients taking theseagents concomitantly.  Valproic Acid  ↓ Valproic Acid  Caution should be used when prescribing valproicacid. Valproic acid may be less effective due to decreased valproicacid plasma concentration in patients taking APTIVUS concomitantly.  Antidepressants:  Trazodone  ↑ Trazodone  Concomitant use of trazodone and APTIVUS/ritonavir may increaseplasma concentrations of trazodone. Adverse events of nausea, dizziness,hypotension, and syncope have been observed following co-administrationof trazodone and ritonavir. If trazodone is used with a CYP 3A4 inhibitorsuch as APTIVUS/ritonavir, the combination should be used with cautionand a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.  Desipramine  Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied ↑ Desipramine  Dosage reduction and concentration monitoring ofdesipramine is recommended.  Selective Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitors:  Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied  Antidepressants have a wide therapeutic index, butdoses may need to be adjusted upon initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavirtherapy.  Fluoxetine Paroxetine Sertraline  ↑ Fluoxetine ↑ Paroxetine ↑Sertraline  Anti-HCV agents:  Boceprevir  Co-administration of APTIVUS and boceprevir has notbeen studied.  With concomitant use, changes in exposure were observed both forboceprevir and certain protease inhibitors used for the treatmentof HIV-1 infection or either medication. Information is not availableregarding tipranavir or boceprevir exposure with concomitant use. It is not recommended to co-administer boceprevir with APTIVUS/ritonavir.  Telaprevir  Co-administration of APTIVUS and telaprevir has notbeen studied.  With concomitant use, changes in exposure were observed both fortelaprevir and certain protease inhibitors used for the treatmentof HIV-1 infection or telaprevir. Information is not available regardingtipranavir or telaprevir exposure with concomitant use. It is notrecommended to co-administer telaprevir with APTIVUS/ritonavir.  Anti-gout:  Colchicine  ↑ Colchicine  In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, coadministrationof colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir is contraindicated.  In combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir, the followingdosage adjustments are recommended in patients with normal renal andhepatic function:  Treatmentof gout flares: Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:  0.6 mg (1 tablet) x 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet)1 hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than 3 days.  Prophylaxis of gout flares: Co-administrationof colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir  :  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day,the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day.  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg once a day,the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.  Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever(FMF): Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:  Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twicea day).  Antipsychotics:  Quetiapine  ↑ Quetiapine  Initiation of APTIVUS with ritonavir in patients takingquetiapine:  Consider alternativeantiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures.If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adversereactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendationson adverse reaction monitoring.  Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking APTIVUS with ritonavir:  Refer to the quetiapine prescribing informationfor initial dosing and titration of quetiapine.  Benzodiazepines:  Parenterally administered midazolam  ↑ Midazolam  Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4.Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantlyhigher with oral than parenteral administration. Therefore, APTIVUSshould not be given with orally administered midazolam [  see Contraindications (4)  ]. If APTIVUS is co-administered with parenteral midazolam,close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolongedsedation should be exercised and dosage adjustments should be considered.  Buprenorphine/naloxone  ↔ Buprenorphine ↓ Tipranavir  APTIVUS/ritonavir did not resultin changes in the clinical efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone. Comparedto historical controls tipranavir C min wasdecreased approximately 40% with this combination. Dose adjustmentscannot be recommended.  Calcium ChannelBlockers:  Diltiazem Felodipine Nicardipine Nisoldipine Verapamil  Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavirnot studied. Cannot predict effect of TPV/ritonavir on calcium channelblockers that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp due to conflictingeffect of TPV/ritonavir on CYP3A and P-gp.  ↕Diltiazem ↑ Felodipine (CYP3A substrate but not P-gp substrate) ↕ Nicardipine ↕ Nisoldipine (CYP3A substrate but notclear whether it is a P-gp substrate) ↕ Verapamil  Caution is warranted and clinicalmonitoring of patients is recommended.  Disulfiram/Metronidazole  Combination with TPV/ritonavirnot studied  APTIVUS capsules contain alcohol that can producedisulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram orother drugs which produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole).  Endothelin receptor antagonists  Bosentan  ↑ Bosentan  Co-administration of bosentan in patientson APTIVUS/ritonavir:  In patientswho have been receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir for at least 10 days, startbosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individualtolerability.  Co-administrationof APTIVUS/ritonavir in patients on bosentan:  Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hoursprior to initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir.  Afterat least 10 days following the initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir, resumebosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individualtolerability.
