<Text><Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 ,  12.3 ) To discontinue Zanaflex, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 )  2.1 Dosing Information  Zanaflex Capsules ® or Zanaflex ® tablets may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of Zanaflex peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours.  Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied.  2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment  Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment  Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation  If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [ see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ].</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  Zanaflex is contraindicated in patientstaking potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin [ see  Drug Interactions (7.1 ,  7.2 ) ]. Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin( 4 , 5.5 ,  7.1 ,  7.2 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Zanaflex should not be used with other α 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 ,  7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue Zanaflex if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Zanaflex may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of Zanaflex, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 ,  7.5 ,  7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of Zanaflex ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if Zanaflex is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 ,  7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 25 mL/min): use Zanaflex with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension  Tizanidine is an α 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when Zanaflex is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that Zanaflex be used with other α 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of Zanaflex. Therefore, concomitant use of Zanaflex with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [ see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.1 ,  7.2 ) ]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury  Zanaflex may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment.. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.3) and  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ] 5.3 Sedation  Zanaflex can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of Zanaflex with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Zanaflex with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [ see  Drug Interactions (7.5 ,  7.6 ) ] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms  Zanaflex use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing Zanaflex in patients who develop hallucinations.  5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors  Because of potential drug interactions, Zanaflex is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when Zanaflex is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for Zanaflex therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [ see  Drug Interactions (7.3) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions  Zanaflex can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue Zanaflex and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [ see  Contraindications (4)  ] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment  Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2) and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions  Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  7.1 Fluvoxamine  Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and Zanaflex is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [ see  Contraindications (4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin  Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and Zanaflex is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment  sSee  Contraindications (4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin  Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of Zanaflex with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2–4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Zanaflex therapy. [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives  Concomitant use of Zanaflex with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate Zanaflex with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2–4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Zanaflex therapy. [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.5 Alcohol  Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of Zanaflex. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of Zanaflex. The CNS depressant effects of Zanaflex and alcohol are additive. [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants  The sedative effects of Zanaflex with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Zanaflex with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] 7.7 α 2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that Zanaflex be used with other α 2 -adrenergic agonists.
