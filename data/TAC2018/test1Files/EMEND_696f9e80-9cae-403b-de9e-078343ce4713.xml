Once prepared, it may be administered either by a healthcare provider, patient, or caregiver.  Before you prepare EMEND:  Do not open the pouch of EMEND until ready to prepare the medicine.  Store the pouch at room temperature [between 68°F-77°F (20°C-25°C)].  Table 4: Instructions for Healthcare Providers on How to Prepare EMEND for Oral Suspension  EMEND for oral suspension is packaged as a kit with one 1 mL oral dosing dispenser, one 5 mL oral dosing dispenser, one cap and one mixing cup.  1. Fill the mixing cup with room temperature drinking water.  2. Fill the 5 mL oral dosing dispenser with 4.6 mL of water from the mixing cup.  Make sure no air is in the dispenser - if air is present, remove.  3. Discard all the unused water remaining in the mixing cup.  4. Add the 4.6 mL of water from the dispenser back into the mixing cup.  5. Each pouch of EMEND for oral suspension contains 125 mg of aprepitant which is to be suspended in 4.6 mL of water giving a final concentration of 25 mg/mL. Hold the EMEND for oral suspension pouch upright and shake the contents to the bottom before opening the pouch.  6. Pour the entire contents of the pouch into the 4.6 mL of water in the mixing cup and snap the lid shut.  7. Mix the EMEND suspension gently by swirling 20 times; then gently invert the mixing cup 5 times. To prevent foaming, do not shake the mixing cup. The mixture will be cloudy pink to light pink.  8. Check the EMEND mixture for any clumps or foaming:  If any clumps are present, repeat Step 7 until there are no clumps.  If there is any foam, wait for the foam to disappear before going on to Step 9.  9. Fill the dispenser with the prescribed dose shown above in Table 3.  Choose the dispenser based on dose:  Use 1 mL dispenser if dose is 1 mL or less.  Use 5 mL dispenser if dose is more than 1 mL.  Fill the dispenser with the prescribed dose from the cup.  If the dose is less than 1 mL round to the nearest 0.1 mL.  If the dose is more than 1 mL round to the nearest 0.2 mL.  It is common to have medicine leftover in the cup.  Make sure no air is in the dispenser - if air is present, remove.  Make sure the dispenser contains the prescribed dose.  10. Place the cap on the dispenser until it clicks.  11. If the dose is not administered immediately after measuring, store filled oral dosing dispenser(s) in the refrigerator [between 36°F-46°F (2°C-8°C)] for up to 72 hours prior to use. When dispensing dose(s) to the patient or caregiver, instruct them to refrigerate the oral dosing dispenser(s) until they are ready to administer the dose.  12. When ready to use, the mixture can be kept at room temperature [between 68°F-77°F (20°C-25°C)] for up to 3 hours.  13. Discard the mixing cup along with any remaining suspension.

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  taking pimozide. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of this drug which is a CYP3A4 substrate, potentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions, such as QT prolongation, a known adverse reaction of pimozide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  Known hypersensitivity to any component of this drug. ( 4 )  Concurrent use with pimozide. ( 4 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  CYP3A4 Interactions : Aprepitant is a substrate, weak-to-moderate inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4; See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations regarding contraindications, risk of adverse reactions, and dosage adjustments of EMEND and concomitant drugs. ( 4 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 7.2 )  Warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) : Risk of decreased INR of prothrombin time; monitor INR in 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of EMEND. ( 5.2 , 7.1 )  Hormonal Contraceptives : Efficacy of contraceptives may be reduced during administration of and for 28 days following the last dose of EMEND. Use effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception. ( 5.3 , 7.1 , 8.3 )  5.1 Clinically Significant CYP3A4 Drug Interactions  Aprepitant is a substrate, a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4.  Use of EMEND with other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, may result in increased plasma concentration of the concomitant drug.  Use of pimozide with EMEND is contraindicated due to the risk of significantly increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, potentially resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, a known adverse reaction of pimozide [see Contraindications (4) ].  Use of EMEND with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, diltiazem) may increase plasma concentrations of aprepitant and result in an increased risk of adverse reactions related to EMEND.  Use of EMEND with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may result in a reduction in aprepitant plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of EMEND.  See Table 10 and Table 11 for a listing of potentially significant drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ].  5.2 Decrease in INR with Concomitant Warfarin  Coadministration of EMEND with warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, may result in a clinically significant decrease in International Normalized Ratio (INR) of prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor the INR in patients on chronic warfarin therapy in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of the 3-day regimen of EMEND with each chemotherapy cycle, or following administration of a single 40-mg dose of EMEND for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  5.3 Risk of Reduced Efficacy of Hormonal Contraceptives  Upon coadministration with EMEND, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during administration of and for 28 days following the last dose of EMEND [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Advise patients to use effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception during treatment with EMEND and for 1 month following the last dose of EMEND [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  See Full Prescribing Information for a list of clinically significant drug interactions. ( 4 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 )  7.1 Effect of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs  Aprepitant is a substrate, a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Aprepitant acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3-day regimen (125-mg/80-mg/80-mg) and can increase plasma concentrations of concomitant drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4. Aprepitant acts as a weak inhibitor when administered as a single 40-mg dose and has not been shown to alter the plasma concentrations of concomitant drugs that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with EMEND [see Contraindications (4) ] . Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted, as shown in Table 10.  Table 10: Effects of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs  CYP3A4 Substrates  Pimozide  Clinical Impact  Increased pimozide exposure  Intervention  EMEND is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  Benzodiazepines  Clinical Impact  Increased exposure to midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Intervention  3-day EMEND regimen  Monitor for benzodiazepine-related adverse reactions.  Depending on the clinical situation (e.g., elderly patients) and degree of monitoring available, reduce the dose of intravenous midazolam  Single 40 mg dose of EMEND  No dosage adjustment of the benzodiazepine needed  Dexamethasone  Clinical Impact  Increased dexamethasone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Intervention  3-day EMEND regimen  Reduce the dose of oral dexamethasone by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ].  Single 40 mg dose of EMEND  No dosage adjustment of oral dexamethasone needed  Methylprednisolone  Clinical Impact  Increased methylprednisolone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Intervention  3-day EMEND regimen  Reduce the dose of intravenous methylprednisolone by approximately 25%  Reduce the dose of oral methylprednisolone by approximately 50%  Single 40 mg dose of EMEND  No dosage adjustment of methylprednisolone needed  Chemotherapeutic agents that are metabolized by CYP3A4  Clinical Impact  Increased exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  Vinblastine, vincristine, or ifosfamide or other chemotherapeutic agents  Monitor for chemotherapeutic-related adverse reactions.  Etoposide, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel  No dosage adjustment needed.  Hormonal Contraceptives  Clinical Impact  Decreased hormonal exposure during administration of and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of EMEND [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  Effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception (such as condoms and spermicides) should be used during treatment with EMEND and for 1 month following the last dose of EMEND.  Examples  birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain IUDs  CYP2C9 Substrates  Warfarin  Clinical Impact  Decreased warfarin exposure and prolongation of prothrombin time (INR) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, monitor the prothrombin time (INR) in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of the 3-day EMEND regimen with each chemotherapy cycle, or following administration of a single 40-mg dose of EMEND.  Other  5-HT 3 Antagonists  Clinical Impact  No change in the exposure of the 5-HT 3 antagonist [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  No dosage adjustment needed  Examples  ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron  7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant  Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of EMEND with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant, respectively, as shown in Table 11.  Table 11: Effects of Other Drugs on Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant  Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors  Clinical Impact  Significantly increased exposure of aprepitant may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with EMEND [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  Avoid concomitant use of EMEND  Examples  Moderate inhibitor:  diltiazem  Strong inhibitors:  ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir  Strong CYP3A4 Inducers  Clinical Impact  Substantially decreased exposure of aprepitant in patients chronically taking a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the efficacy of EMEND [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention  Avoid concomitant use of EMEND  Examples  rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin</Section>
