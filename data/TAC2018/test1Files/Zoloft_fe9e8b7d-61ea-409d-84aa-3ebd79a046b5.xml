2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Indication  Starting Dosage  Maximum Dosage  MDD ( 2.1 )  50 mg per day  200 mg per day  OCD ( 2.1 )  25 mg per day (ages 6–12) 50 mg per day (ages ≥ 13)  200 mg per day  PD, PTSD, SAD ( 2.1 )  25 mg per day  200 mg per day  PMDD ( 2.2 ) continuous dosing  50 mg per day  150 mg per day  PMDD ( 2.2 ) intermittent dosing  50 mg per day during luteal phase only  100 mg per day during luteal phase only  If inadequate response to starting dosage, titrate in 25–50 mg per day increments once weekly in MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD ( 2.1 )  See Full Prescribing Information for titration in PMDD ( 2.2 )  Hepatic impairment:  Mild: Recommended starting and maximum dosage is half recommended dosage ( 2.4 )  Moderate or severe: Not recommended ( 2.4 )  When discontinuing ZOLOFT, reduce dose gradually ( 2.6 , 5.4 )  Oral solution: Must be diluted before administration ( 2.7 )  2.1 Dosage in Patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD  The recommended initial dosage and maximum ZOLOFT dosage in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD are displayed in Table 1 below. A dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg per day is the initial therapeutic dosage.  For adults and pediatric patients, subsequent dosages may be increased in case of an inadequate response in 25 to 50 mg per day increments once a week, depending on tolerability, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day. Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of ZOLOFT, the recommended interval between dose changes is one week.  Table 1: Recommended Daily Dosage of ZOLOFT in Patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD  Indication  Starting Dose  Therapeutic Range  Adults    MDD  50 mg  50–200 mg    OCD  50 mg    PD, PTSD, SAD  25 mg  Pediatric Patients    OCD (ages 6–12 years old)  25 mg  50–200 mg    OCD (ages 13–17 years old)  50 mg  2.2 Dosage in Patients with PMDD  The recommended starting ZOLOFT dosage in adult women with PMDD is 50 mg per day. ZOLOFT may be administered either continuously (every day throughout the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., starting the daily dosage 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation and continuing through the onset of menses). Intermittent dosing would be repeated with each new cycle.  When dosing continuously , patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from dosage increases at 50 mg increments per menstrual cycle up to 150 mg per day.  When dosing intermittently , patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from increasing the dosage up to a maximum of 100 mg per day during the next menstrual cycle (and subsequent cycles) as follows: 50 mg per day during the first 3 days of dosing followed by 100 mg per day during the remaining days in the dosing cycle.  2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting ZOLOFT  Prior to initiating treatment with ZOLOFT or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].  2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment  Both the recommended starting dosage and therapeutic range in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 5 or 6) are half the recommended daily dosage [See Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2) ] . The use of ZOLOFT in patients with moderate (Child Pugh scores 7 to 9) or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 10–15) is not recommended [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  2.5 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant  At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of ZOLOFT. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping ZOLOFT before starting an MAOI antidepressant [See Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with ZOLOFT  Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of ZOLOFT [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping ZOLOFT abruptly whenever possible.  2.7 Preparation of ZOLOFT Oral Solution  ZOLOFT oral solution must be diluted before use.  Use the supplied calibrated dropper to measure the amount of ZOLOFT oral solution needed  Note: The supplied calibrated dropper has 25 mg and 50 mg graduation marks only  Mix with 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade or orange juice ONLY. After mixing, a slight haze may appear, which is normal.  Instruct patients or caregivers to immediately take the dose after mixing.</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  ZOLOFT is contraindicated in patients:  Taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs, (including the MAOIs linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  Taking pimozide [See Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  With known hypersensitivity to sertraline (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) [See Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ].  In addition to the contraindications for all ZOLOFT formulations listed above, ZOLOFT oral solution is contraindicated in patients:  Taking disulfiram. ZOLOFT oral solution contains alcohol, and concomitant use of ZOLOFT and disulfiram may result in a disulfiram-alcohol reaction.  Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or use within 14 days of stopping MAOIs ( 4 , 7.1 )  Concomitant use of pimozide ( 4 , 7.1 )  Known hypersensitivity to sertraline or excipients ( 4 , 5.4 )  ZOLOFT oral solution only: Concomitant use of disulfiram ( 4 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue ZOLOFT and initiate supportive treatment. ( 5.2 )  Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk. ( 5.3 )  Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.4 )  Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.6 )  Angle Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including ZOLOFT, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. ( 5.7 )  QTc Prolongation: ZOLOFT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation. ( 5.10 )  5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients  In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.  No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.  Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Cases of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients  Age Range (years)  Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated  Increases Compared to Placebo  &lt;18  14 additional patients  18–24  5 additional patients  Decreases Compared to Placebo  25–64  1 fewer patient  ≥65  6 fewer patients  It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.  Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing ZOLOFT, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.  5.2 Serotonin Syndrome  Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including ZOLOFT, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [See Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.  Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  The concomitant use of ZOLOFT with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate ZOLOFT in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking ZOLOFT, discontinue ZOLOFT before initiating treatment with the MAOI [See Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  Monitor all patients taking ZOLOFT for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with ZOLOFT and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of ZOLOFT with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.  5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding  Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including ZOLOFT, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.  Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.  5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania  In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with ZOLOFT or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with ZOLOFT. Prior to initiating treatment with ZOLOFT, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.  5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome  Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] .  5.6 Seizures  ZOLOFT has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. ZOLOFT should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.  5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma  The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including ZOLOFT may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including ZOLOFT, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.  5.8 Hyponatremia  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including ZOLOFT. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).  In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue ZOLOFT and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .  5.9 False-Positive Effects on Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines  False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking ZOLOFT. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of ZOLOFT. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will help distinguish ZOLOFT from benzodiazepines [See Drug Interactions (7.3) ] .  5.10 QTc Prolongation  During post-marketing use of sertraline, cases of QTc prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) have been reported. Most reports were confounded by other risk factors. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects, there was a positive relationship between the length of the rate-adjusted QTc interval and serum sertraline concentration. Therefore, ZOLOFT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation [See Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Protein-bound drugs: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of ZOLOFT or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7.1 , 12.3 )  CYP2D6 substrates: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 ( 7.1 , 12.3 )  7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions  Table 5 includes clinically significant drug interactions with ZOLOFT [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Table 5. Clinically-Significant Drug Interactions with ZOLOFT  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)  Clinical Impact:  The concomitant use of SSRIs including ZOLOFT and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Intervention:  ZOLOFT is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [See Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  Examples:  selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue  Pimozide  Clinical Impact:  Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias.  Intervention:  Concomitant use of pimozide and ZOLOFT is contraindicated [See Contraindications (4) ].  Other Serotonergic Drugs  Clinical Impact:  The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with ZOLOFT increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Intervention:  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of ZOLOFT and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  Examples:  other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort  Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants)  Clinical Impact:  The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with ZOLOFT may potentiate the risk of bleeding.  Intervention:  Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].  Examples:  aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin  Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein  Clinical Impact:  ZOLOFT is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of ZOLOFT with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of ZOLOFT or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Intervention:  Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of ZOLOFT or other protein-bound drugs as warranted.  Examples:  warfarin  Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6  Clinical Impact:  ZOLOFT is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The concomitant use of ZOLOFT with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate.  Intervention:  Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant ZOLOFT use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if ZOLOFT is discontinued.  Examples:  propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, thoridazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine  Phenytoin  Clinical Impact:  Phenytoin is a narrow therapeutic index drug. ZOLOFT may increase phenytoin concentrations.  Intervention:  Monitor phenytoin levels when initiating or titrating ZOLOFT. Reduce phenytoin dosage if needed.  Examples:  phenytoin, fosphenytoin  Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval  Clinical Impact:  The risk of QTc prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., TdP) is increased with concomitant use of other drugs which prolong the QTc interval [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  Intervention:  Pimozide is contraindicated for use with sertraline. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval.  Examples:  Specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).  7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ZOLOFT  Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of ZOLOFT is necessary when used in combination with cimetidine. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is required for diazepam, lithium, atenolol, tolbutamide, digoxin, and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, when ZOLOFT is administered concomitantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  7.3 False-Positive Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines  False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking ZOLOFT. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of ZOLOFT. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines.</Section>
