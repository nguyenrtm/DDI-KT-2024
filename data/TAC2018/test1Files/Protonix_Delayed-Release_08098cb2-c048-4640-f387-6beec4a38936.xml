Doses up to 240 mg daily have been administered.  2.2 Administration Instructions  Directions for method of administration for each dosage form are presented in Table 2.  Table 2: Administration Instructions  Formulation  Route  Instructions Do not split, chew, or crush PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets and PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension.  Delayed-Release Tablets  Oral  Swallowed whole, with or without food  For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension  Oral  Administered in 1 teaspoonful of applesauce or apple juice approximately 30 minutes prior to a meal  For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension  Nasogastric tube  See instructions below  Take a missed dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.  PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets  Swallow PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets whole, with or without food in the stomach. For patients unable to swallow a 40 mg tablet, two 20 mg tablets may be taken. Concomitant administration of antacids does not affect the absorption of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets.  PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension  Administer PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension approximately 30 minutes prior to a meal via oral administration in apple juice or applesauce or nasogastric tube in apple juice only. Because proper pH is necessary for stability, do not administer PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension in liquids other than apple juice, or foods other than applesauce.  Do not divide the 40 mg PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension packet to create a 20 mg dosage for pediatric patients who are unable to take the tablet formulation.  PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension - Oral Administration in Applesauce  Open packet.  Sprinkle granules on one teaspoonful of applesauce. DO NOT USE OTHER FOODS OR CRUSH OR CHEW THE GRANULES.  Take within 10 minutes of preparation.  Take sips of water to make sure granules are washed down into the stomach. Repeat water sips as necessary.  PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension - Oral Administration in Apple Juice  Open packet.  Empty granules into a small cup or teaspoon containing one teaspoon of apple juice.  Stir for 5 seconds (granules will not dissolve) and swallow immediately.  To make sure that the entire dose is taken, rinse the container once or twice with apple juice to remove any remaining granules. Swallow immediately.  PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension - Nasogastric (NG) Tube or Gastrostomy Tube Administration  For patients who have a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube in place, PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension can be given as follows:  Remove the plunger from the barrel of a 2 ounce (60 mL) catheter-tip syringe. Discard the plunger.  Connect the catheter tip of the syringe to a 16 French (or larger) tube.  Hold the syringe attached to the tubing as high as possible while giving PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension to prevent any bending of the tubing.  Empty the contents of the packet into the barrel of the syringe.  Add 10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) of apple juice and gently tap and/or shake the barrel of the syringe to help rinse the syringe and tube. Repeat at least twice more using the same amount of apple juice (10 mL or 2 teaspoonfuls) each time. No granules should remain in the syringe.</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  PROTONIX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or any substituted benzimidazole. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] .  Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including PROTONIX, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or to substituted benzimidazoles ( 4 )  Patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products ( 4 , 7 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 )  Acute Interstitial Nephritis : Observed in patients taking PPIs. ( 5.2 )  Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea. ( 5.3 )  Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.4 )  Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue PROTONIX and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.5 )  Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.6 )  Hypomagnesemia : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.7 )  5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with PROTONIX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.  5.2 Acute Interstitial Nephritis  Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including PROTONIX. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue PROTONIX if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4) ].  5.3 Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea  Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like PROTONIX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.  5.4 Bone Fracture  Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].  5.5 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.  The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.  Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving PROTONIX, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.  5.6 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency  Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.  5.7 Hypomagnesemia  Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.  For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  5.8 Tumorigenicity  Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of PROTONIX. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] .  5.9 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors  Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop PROTONIX treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  5.10 Interference with Urine Screen for THC  There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs, including PROTONIX [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .  5.11 Concomitant Use of PROTONIX with Methotrexate  Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ].</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Table 4 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with PROTONIX and instructions for preventing or managing them.  Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs.  Table 4: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with PROTONIX and Interactions with Diagnostics  Antiretrovirals  Clinical Impact:  The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.  Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with pantoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.  Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with pantoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs .  There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with pantoprazole.  Intervention:  Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with PROTONIX is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . See prescribing information. Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information. Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with PROTONIX. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities. Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information.  Warfarin  Clinical Impact:  Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole , and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.  Intervention:  Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin.  Clopidogrel  Clinical Impact:  Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Intervention:  No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of PROTONIX.  Methotrexate  Clinical Impact:  Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] .  Intervention:  A temporary withdrawal of PROTONIX may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.  Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole)  Clinical Impact:  Pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.  Intervention:  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of pantoprazole sodium in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PROTONIX and MMF. Use PROTONIX with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.  Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors  Clinical Impact:  CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  Intervention:  Temporarily stop PROTONIX treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.  False Positive Urine Tests for THC  Clinical Impact:  There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .  Intervention:  An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.
