2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  INVIRASE must be used in combination with ritonavir because ritonavir significantly inhibits saquinavir's metabolism to provide increased plasma saquinavir levels.  Cobicistat is not interchangeable with ritonavir to increase systemic exposure of saquinavir [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .  INVIRASE must be administered in combination with ritonavir. ( 2 )  Adults (over the age of 16 years ): INVIRASE 1000 mg twice daily (5 × 200 mg capsules or 2 × 500 mg tablets) in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. ( 2.1 )  Treatment-naïve patients initiating treatment with INVIRASE/ritonavir: First 7 days of treatment: INVIRASE 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. After 7 days: INVIRASE 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. ( 2.1 )  See Full Prescribing Information for dosing recommendations for patients switching immediately from treatment with another protease inhibitor taken with ritonavir or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based regimen, without a wash-out period. ( 2.1 )  INVIRASE and ritonavir should be taken within 2 hours after a meal. ( 2.1 )  2.1 Recommended Dose  The standard recommended dose of INVIRASE is 1000-mg twice daily (5 × 200-mg capsules or 2 × 500-mg tablets) in combination with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily.  For treatment-naïve patients initiating treatment with INVIRASE/ritonavir, the recommended starting dose of INVIRASE is 500-mg twice daily with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily for the first 7 days of treatment. After 7 days, the recommended dose of INVIRASE is 1000-mg twice daily with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  Patients switching immediately (no washout period) from treatment with another ritonavir containing regimen or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based regimen (not including delavirdine, rilpivirine) should initiate and continue INVIRASE at the standard recommended dose of 1000-mg twice daily with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily. For patients switching from a regimen containing delavirdine or rilpivirine, the recommended dose is 500-mg twice daily with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily for the first 7 days of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] .  Ritonavir should be taken at the same time as INVIRASE.  INVIRASE and ritonavir should be taken within 2 hours after a meal.  For patients already taking ritonavir 100-mg twice daily as part of their antiretroviral regimen, no additional ritonavir is needed.  Pediatric dose recommendations that are both reliably effective and below thresholds of concern for QT and PR interval prolongation could not be determined.  2.2 Administration for Patients Unable to Swallow Capsules  Open the INVIRASE capsules and place the contents into an empty container. Add 15 mL of either sugar syrup or sorbitol syrup (for patients with Type 1 diabetes or glucose intolerance) OR 3 teaspoons of jam to the contents of INVIRASE capsules that are in the container. Stir with a spoon for 30 to 60 seconds. Administer the full amount prepared for each dose. Suspensions should be at room temperature before administering.</Section>

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported rarely with INVIRASE/ritonavir use. Do not use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with refractory hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and in combination with drugs that both increase saquinavir plasma concentrations and prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  INVIRASE is contraindicated in patients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block without implanted pacemakers, or patients who are at high risk of complete AV block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  INVIRASE is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to saquinavir, saquinavir mesylate, or any of its ingredients.  INVIRASE when administered with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs that are CYP3A substrates for which increased plasma levels may result in serious or life-threatening reactions. These drugs and potentially related adverse events are listed in  Table 1  .  Table 1 Drugs That Are Contraindicated With INVIRASE/ritonavir  Drug Class  Drugs Within Class That Are Contraindicated With INVIRASE/ritonavir  Clinical Comment  Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist  Alfuzosin  Potentially increased alfuzosin concentrations can result in hypotension.

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  INVIRASE must be used in combination with ritonavir. Please refer to the ritonavir full prescribing information for additional precautionary measures.  INVIRASE is not recommended for use in combination with cobicistat. Dosing recommendations for this combination have not been established. Cobicistat is also not recommended in combination with regimens containing ritonavir due to similar effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A. Please refer to the cobicistat full prescribing information for additional precautionary measures.  If a serious or severe toxicity occurs during treatment with INVIRASE, INVIRASE should be interrupted until the etiology of the event is identified or the toxicity resolves. At that time, resumption of treatment with full-dose INVIRASE may be considered. For antiretroviral agents used in combination with INVIRASE, physicians should refer to the complete product information for these drugs for dose adjustment recommendations and for information regarding drug-associated adverse reactions.  The concomitant use of INVIRASE/ritonavir and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions ( 5.1 , 7.3 )  QT and PR interval prolongations have been observed in a healthy volunteer study. Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system abnormalities and certain heart diseases. ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 12.2 )  Patients on INVIRASE therapy may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus ( 5.4 ), hyperglycemia ( 5.4 ), elevated cholesterol and/or triglyceride concentrations ( 5.7 ), redistribution/accumulation of body fat ( 5.9 ), and immune reconstitution syndrome ( 5.10 ). Monitor cholesterol and triglycerides prior to therapy and periodically thereafter. ( 5.7 )  In patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism and/or other underlying liver abnormalities there have been reports of worsening liver disease. ( 5.5 )  Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur and additional factor VII may be required. ( 5.6 )  Various degrees of cross-resistance have been observed. ( 5.11 )  5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of INVIRASE/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of INVIRASE/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:  Clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.  Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Loss of therapeutic effect of INVIRASE/ritonavir and possible development of resistance.  See  Table 3  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during INVIRASE/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during INVIRASE/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ].  5.2 PR Interval Prolongation  Saquinavir/ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in a dose-dependent fashion. Cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported rarely. Patients with underlying structural heart disease, pre-existing conduction system abnormalities, cardiomyopathies and ischemic heart disease may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities. ECG monitoring is recommended in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .  The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A, and clinical monitoring is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  5.3 QT Interval Prolongation  Saquinavir/ritonavir causes dose-dependent QT prolongation. Torsades de pointes has been reported rarely post-marketing. Avoid saquinavir/ritonavir in patients with long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, hepatic impairment and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating saquinavir/ritonavir and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Do not use in combination with drugs that both increase saquinavir plasma concentrations and prolong the QT interval (see  Tables 1  and  3  ) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  Patients initiating therapy with INVIRASE/ritonavir:  An ECG should be performed prior to initiation of treatment. Patients with a QT interval ≥ 450 msec should not initiate treatment with INVIRASE/ritonavir. Treatment-naïve patients initiating treatment with INVIRASE/ritonavir should receive a reduced starting dose of INVIRASE 500-mg twice daily with ritonavir 100-mg twice daily for the first 7 days of treatment followed by INVIRASE/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily due to potential for an increased risk of PR and QT interval prolongation with the standard 1000/100-mg twice daily dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  For patients with a baseline QT interval &lt; 450 msec, an on-treatment ECG is recommended after approximately 10 days of therapy.  Patients with a QT interval prolongation over pre-treatment by &gt; 20 msec should discontinue INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Patients requiring treatment with medications with the potential to increase the QT interval and concomitant INVIRASE/ritonavir:  Such combinations should only be used where no alternative therapy is available and the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. An ECG should be performed prior to initiation of the concomitant therapy, and patients with a QT interval &gt; 450 msec should not initiate the concomitant therapy. If baseline QT interval &lt; 450 msec, an on-treatment ECG should be performed after 3-4 days of therapy. For patients demonstrating a subsequent increase in QT interval by &gt; 20 msec after commencing concomitant therapy, the physician should use best clinical judgment to discontinue either INVIRASE/ritonavir or the concomitant therapy or both.  A cardiology consult is recommended if drug discontinuation or interruption is being considered on the basis of ECG assessment.  5.4 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving protease-inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of these events. In some cases diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease-inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease-inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.  5.5 Hepatotoxicity  In patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism and/or other underlying liver abnormalities, there have been reports of worsening liver disease.  5.6 Hemophilia  There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was required. In the majority of reported cases treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.  5.7 Hyperlipidemia  Elevated cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels have been observed in some patients taking saquinavir in combination with ritonavir. Marked elevation in triglyceride levels is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be monitored prior to initiating combination dosing regimen of INVIRASE with ritonavir, and at periodic intervals while on such therapy. In these patients, lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.  5.8 Lactose Intolerance  Each capsule contains lactose (anhydrous) 63.3 mg. This quantity should not induce specific symptoms of intolerance.  5.9 Fat Redistribution  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), facial wasting, peripheral wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including INVIRASE. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  5.11 Resistance/Cross-resistance  Varying degrees of cross-resistance among HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been observed. Continued administration of INVIRASE therapy following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross resistance to other protease inhibitors [see Microbiology (12.4) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Drug interaction studies have been completed with both INVIRASE and saquinavir soft gel capsules. Observations from drug interaction studies with saquinavir soft gel capsules may not be predictive for INVIRASE/ritonavir. Because ritonavir is coadministered with INVIRASE, prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for ritonavir regarding drug interactions associated with this agent.  INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, significantly increasing the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. ( 7.1 )  Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir with drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced efficacy. ( 7.2 )  Certain drugs or drug classes should not be coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir based on drug interaction studies or predicted drug interactions. ( 5.1 , 7.2 , 7.3 )  7.1 Potential for INVIRASE to Affect Other Drugs  The combination INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and may significantly increase the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Drugs that are contraindicated specifically due to the observed or expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious or life-threatening adverse events are listed in  Table 1  [see Contraindications (4) ] . Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring (see  Table 3  ).  7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVIRASE  The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated primarily by CYP3A. Additionally, saquinavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, drugs that affect CYP3A and/or P-gp may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Coadministration with drugs that are potent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced therapeutic effect.  7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Based on the finding of dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals in healthy volunteers receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir, additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with certain members of the following drug classes: antiarrhythmics class IA or class III, neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, PDE5 inhibitors (when used for pulmonary arterial hypertension), antimicrobials, antihistaminics and others. This effect might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, notably torsades de pointes. Therefore, concurrent administration of these agents with INVIRASE/ritonavir is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  Table 3  provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. Alteration in dose or avoidance of the combination may be recommended depending on the interaction.  Table 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or on Predicted Interaction with INVIRASE/ritonavir  Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name  Effect on Concentration of Saquinavir or Concomitant Drug  Clinical Comment  HIV-1 Antiviral Agents  Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:  Zalcitabine Zidovudine INVIRASE/ritonavir interaction has not been evaluated.  ↔ Saquinavir  A pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely due to different routes of metabolism and excretion. No dose adjustment is required.  Nuceloside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:  Didanosine  ↓Saquinavir  Clinical significance unknown. No dose adjustment required.  Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  ↔ Saquinavir  No clinically significant effect on saquinavir exposure. No dose adjustment required.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:  Delavirdine  ↑ Saquinavir  Effect on delavirdine is not well established  Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Coadministration is not recommended. Liver function should be monitored frequently if this combination is prescribed. Hepatocellular changes should be monitored frequently if this combination is prescribed.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:  Efavirenz See  Pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions (12.3), Table 6  and  Table 7  for magnitude of interactions. , nevirapine  ↓ Saquinavir ↔ Efavirenz  Appropriate doses of the combination of efavirenz or nevirapine and INVIRASE/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Coadministration is not recommended.  HIV-1 protease inhibitor:  Fosamprenavir  ↓ Saquinavir  No dose adjustment required for INVIRASE/ritonavir.  HIV-1 protease inhibitor:  Indinavir  ↑ Saquinavir ↑ Indinavir  Low dose ritonavir increases the concentration of indinavir  Appropriate doses of the combination of indinavir and INVIRASE/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Coadministration is not recommended. Increased concentrations of indinavir may result in nephrolithiasis. For further details see complete prescribing information for Crixivan ® (indinavir).  HIV-1 protease inhibitor:  Lopinavir/ritonavir (coformulated tablet)  ↔ Saquinavir ↔ Lopinavir ↓ Ritonavir  Evidence from several clinical trials indicates that saquinavir concentrations achieved with the saquinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combination are similar to those achieved following INVIRASE/ritonavir 1000/100 mg. The recommended dose for this combination is INVIRASE 1000 mg plus lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg bid.  Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with INVIRASE should be used with caution. Additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with INVIRASE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,  5.3) ].  HIV-1 protease inhibitor:  Nelfinavir  ↑ Saquinavir  Combining saquinavir/ritonavir with nelfinavir is not recommended.  HIV-1 protease inhibitor:  Tipranavir/ritonavir  ↓ Saquinavir  Combining saquinavir with tipranavir/ritonavir is not recommended. If the combination is nevertheless considered necessary, monitoring of saquinavir concentrations is recommended.  HIV-1 CCR5 antagonist:  Maraviroc  ↑ Maraviroc  Maraviroc dose should be 150 mg twice daily when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir. For further details see complete prescribing information for Selzentry ® (maraviroc).  Other Agents  Ibutilide Sotalol  Additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with INVIRASE/ritonavir [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2,  5.3) ] . Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir and ibutilide or sotalol is not recommended.  Anticoagulant:  Warfarin  ↑ Warfarin  Concentrations of warfarin may be affected. It is recommended that INR (international normalized ratio) be monitored.  Anticonvulsants:  Carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin  ↓ Saquinavir  Effect on carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin is not well established  Saquinavir may be less effective due to decreased saquinavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly. Coadministration is not recommended. Monitoring of saquinavir concentrations is recommended.  Anti-gout:  Colchicine  ↑ Colchicine  Treatment of gout flares-coadministration of colchicine in patients on INVIRASE/ritonavir:  0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than 3 days.  Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) coadministration of colchicine in patients on INVIRASE/ritonavir:  Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).  Prophylaxis of gout-flares-co-administration of colchicine in patients on INVIRASE/ritonavir:  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day.  If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Streptogramin antibiotics (quinupristin/dalfopristin )  Streptogramin antibiotics such as quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibit CYP3A4; saquinavir concentrations may be increased  Monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended. Use with caution due to possible cardiac arrhythmias.  Fusidic acid  ↑ Saquinavir ↑ Fusidic Acid ↑ Ritonavir  Concomitant use of fusidic acid and INVIRASE/ritonavir is not recommended due to potential for increased mutual toxicities.   The interaction between INVIRASE/ritonavir and fusidic acid has not been formally evaluated. Co-administration of fusidic acid and INVIRASE/ritonavir can cause increased plasma concentrations of fusidic acid, saquinavir and ritonavir.  Antifungal:  Ketoconazole , itraconazole  ↔ Saquinavir ↔ Ritonavir ↑ Ketoconazole  When INVIRASE/ritonavir and ketoconazole are coadministered, plasma concentrations of ketoconazole are increased (see  Table 6  ). Hence, doses of ketoconazole or itraconazole &gt;200 mg/day are not recommended.  Antimycobacterial:  Rifabutin  ↔ Saquinavir ↑ Rifabutin ↔ Ritonavir  No dose adjustment of INVIRASE/ritonavir (1000/100 mg bid) is required if INVIRASE/ritonavir is administered in combination with rifabutin.  Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week). Increased monitoring for adverse events including neutropenia and liver enzyme levels is warranted in patients receiving the combination.  Consider monitoring rifabutin concentrations to ensure adequate exposure.  Antipsychotic:  Quetiapine  ↑ Quetiapine  Initiation of INVIRASE with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine:  Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine drug exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.  Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking INVIRASE with ritonavir:  Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine.  Benzodiazepines  :  Alprazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, flurazepam  ↑ Benzodiazepines  Clinical significance is unknown. Careful monitoring of patients for benzodiazepine effects is warranted; a decrease in benzodiazepine dose may be needed.  Benzodiazepine  :  Intravenously administered Midazolam  ↑ Midazolam  If INVIRASE/ritonavir is coadministered with parenteral midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered.  Calcium channel blockers  :  Diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, verapamil, amlodipine, nisoldipine, isradipine  ↑ Calcium channel blockers  Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended.  Corticosteroid:  Dexamethasone  ↓ Saquinavir  INVIRASE/ritonavir may be less effective due to decreased saquinavir plasma concentrations. Coadministration is not recommended.  Digitalis Glycosides: Digoxin  ↑ Digoxin  Increases in serum digoxin concentration were greater in female subjects as compared to male subjects when digoxin was coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Caution should be exercised when INVIRASE/ritonavir and digoxin are coadministered; serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and the dose of digoxin may need to be reduced when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Endothelin receptor antagonists:  Bosentan  ↑ Bosentan  Coadministration of bosentan in patients on INVIRASE/ritonavir:  In patients who have been receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir in patients on bosentan:  Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of INVIRASE/ritonavir.  After at least 10 days following the initiation of INVIRASE/ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.  Inhaled beta agonist:  Salmeterol  ↑ Salmeterol  Concurrent administration of salmeterol with INVIRASE/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.  Inhaled/nasal steroids:  Fluticasone  Budesonide  ↑ Fluticasone  Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and INVIRASE/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Several cases of Cushing's disease associated with this interaction have been reported in the literature. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and INVIRASE/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. If the combination is nevertheless considered necessary, a dose reduction of fluticasone propionate with close monitoring of local and systemic effects is recommended. A switch to a corticosteroid which is not a substrate for CYP3A (e.g., beclomethasone) should be considered. In case of withdrawal of corticosteroids, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors  :  Atorvastatin  ↑ Atorvastatin  Titrate atorvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest dose necessary; do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg/day. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy (e.g., muscle weakness, muscle pain, rising creatine kinase).  Immunosuppressants  :  Cyclosporine, rapamycin  ↑ Immunosuppressants  Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant agents when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Narcotic analgesic:  Methadone  ↓ Methadone  Dosage of methadone may need to be increased when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Use with caution. Additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with INVIRASE/ritonavir [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2,  5.3) ] .  Oral contraceptives:  Ethinyl estradiol  ↓ Ethinyl estradiol  Alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be used when estrogen-based oral contraceptives and INVIRASE/ritonavir are coadministered.  PDE5 inhibitors (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors):  Sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil  ↑ Sildenafil ↔ Saquinavir  ↑ Vardenafil ↑ Tadalafil  Only the combination of sildenafil with saquinavir soft gelatin capsules has been studied at doses used for treatment of erectile dysfunction.  May result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism.  Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):  Use of sildenafil (Revatio) is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [see Contraindications (4) ] .  The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil (Adcirca ® ) with INVIRASE/ritonavir:  Coadministration of Adcirca in patients on INVIRASE/ritonavir:  In patients receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir for at least one week, start Adcirca at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir in patients on Adcirca:  Avoid use of Adcirca during the initiation of INVIRASE/ritonavir. Stop Adcirca at least 24 hours prior to starting INVIRASE/ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of INVIRASE/ritonavir, resume Adcirca at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.  Use of PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction:  Use sildenafil with caution at reduced doses of 25 mg every 48 hours with increased monitoring of adverse events when administered concomitantly with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2.5 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring of adverse events when administered concomitantly with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Use tadalafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 10 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring of adverse events when administered concomitantly with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Tricyclic antidepressants  : Amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, maprotiline  ↑ Tricyclics  Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for tricyclic antidepressants when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.  Other antidepressants:  Nefazodone  ↑ Saquinavir Nefazodone inhibits CYP3A4; saquinavir concentrations may be increased  Monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended.  Proton pump inhibitors: Omeprazole  ↑ Saquinavir  When INVIRASE/ritonavir is co-administered with omeprazole, saquinavir concentrations are increased significantly. If omeprazole or another proton pump inhibitor is taken concomitantly with INVIRASE/ritonavir, caution is advised and monitoring for potential saquinavir toxicities is recommended, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, increased triglycerides, deep vein thrombosis, and QT prolongation.  Herbal Products:  St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum)  ↓ Saquinavir  Herbal products containing St. John's wort should not be used concomitantly with INVIRASE/ritonavir because coadministration may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to INVIRASE or to the class of protease inhibitors.  Other drugs that are substrates of CYP3A:  Fentanyl  Alfentanil  ↑ Fentanyl ↑ Alfentanil  Coadministration with these drugs may accentuate the side effects reported with use of fentanyl or alfentanil including respiratory depression, apnea and bradycardia.  Vasodilators (peripheral):  Intravenously administered Vincamine  ↑ Vincamine  Monitoring for vincamine toxicity is recommended. Use with caution due to potential cardiac arrhythmias.  Garlic Capsules  ↓ Saquinavir  Coadministration of garlic capsules and saquinavir is not recommended due to the potential for garlic capsules to induce the metabolism of saquinavir which may result in sub-therapeutic saquinavir concentrations.  7.4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with INVIRASE/ritonavir  Based on drug interaction studies conducted with INVIRASE/ritonavir, no clinically significant effect was observed for saquinavir when coadministered with fosamprenavir. No clinically significant effect was observed for enfuvirtide when coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir.</Section>
