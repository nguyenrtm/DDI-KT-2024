WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME AND CARDIAC CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES  Differentiation Syndrome: Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with TRISENOX have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and renal, hepatic, or multi-organ dysfunction, in the presence or absence of leukocytosis. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, immediately initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Temporary discontinuation of TRISENOX may be required [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )].  Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: Arsenic trioxide can cause QTc interval prolongation, complete atrioventricular block, and a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. Before initiating therapy, assess the QTc interval, correct pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTcF [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )].  WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME AND   CARDIAC CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES    See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  Patients treated with TRISENOX may develop differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal. If symptoms occur, initiate high-dose steroids immediately and monitor hemodynamics. ( 5.1 )  TRISENOX can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal.  Before administering TRISENOX, assess the QT interval, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QT interval.  Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTcF.

Relapsed or Refractory APL  A treatment course including TRISENOX monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory APL consists of 1 induction cycle and 1 consolidation cycle [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] .  For the induction cycle, the recommended dose of TRISENOX is 0.15 mg/kg intravenously daily until bone marrow remission or up to a maximum of 60 days.  For the consolidation cycle, the recommended dose of TRISENOX is 0.15 mg/kg intravenously daily for 25 doses over a period of up to 5 weeks.  Begin consolidation 3 to 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy.  2.2 DoseModifications for Toxicities  During induction therapy, monitor coagulation studies, blood counts, and chemistries at least 2-3 times per week through recovery.  During consolidation, monitor at least weekly.  Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of TRISENOX [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Table 2 shows the dose modifications for toxicity due to TRISENOX when used alone or in combination with tretinoin.   Table 2:  Dose Adjustments for Adverse Reactions    Adverse Reaction(s)    Dose Modification  Differentiation syndrome, defined by the presence of 2 or more of the following:  Unexplained fever  Dyspnea  Pleural and/or pericardial effusion  Pulmonary infiltrates  Renal failure  Hypotension  Weight gain greater than 5 kg   Temporarily withhold TRISENOX.  Consider holding tretinoin if symptoms are severe.  Treat with dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until the resolution of signs and symptoms for a minimum of 3 days.  Resume treatment when the clinical condition improves and reduce the dose of the withheld drug(s) by 50%.  Increase the dose of the withheld drug(s) to the recommended dosage after 7 days in the absence of recurrence of symptoms of differentiation syndrome.  If symptoms re-appear, decrease TRISENOX and/or tretinoin to the previous dose.  QTc Prolongation greater than 450 msec for men or greater than 460 msec for women:  Withhold treatment with TRISENOX and any medication known to prolong the QTc interval.  Replete electrolytes.  After the QTc normalizes, resume treatment with TRISENOX at a 50% reduced dose (0.075 mg/kg once daily) for 7 days.  If the 50% reduced dose is tolerated for 7 days (in the absence of QTc prolongation), increase the dose of TRISENOX to 0.11 mg/kg once daily for 7 days.  The dose of TRISENOX can be increased to 0.15 mg/kg in the absence of QTc prolongation during that 14-day dose-escalation period.   Hepatotoxicity, defined by 1 or more of the following:  Total bilirubin (TB) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 5 times the ULN  Alkaline phosphatase (AP) greater than 5 times the ULN  Withhold treatment with TRISENOX and/or tretinoin.  Resume treatment at a 50% reduced dose of the withheld drug(s) when TB is less than 1.5 times the ULN and AP/AST are less than 3 times the ULN.  Increase the dose of the withheld drug(s) back to the recommended dosage after 7 days on the reduced dose in the absence of worsening of hepatotoxicity.  Discontinue the withheld drug(s) permanently if hepatotoxicity recurs.   Other severe or life-threatening (grade 3-4) nonhematologic reactions  Temporarily withhold TRISENOX and tretinoin.  When the adverse reaction resolves to no more than mild (grade 1), resume TRISENOX and tretinoin reduced by 2 dose levels (see Table 3 below).   Moderate (grade 2) nonhematologic reactions  Reduce the dose of TRISENOX and/or tretinoin by 1 dose level (see Table 3 below).   Leukocytosis (WBC count greater than 10 Gi/L)  Administer hydroxyurea.  Hydroxyurea may be discontinued when the WBC declines below 10 Gi/L.  Myelosuppression, defined by 1 or more of the following:  absolute neutrophil count less than 1 Gi/L  platelets less than 50 Gi/L lasting more than 5 weeks  Consider reducing the dose of TRISENOX and tretinoin by 1 dose level (see Table 3 below).  If myelosuppression lasts ≥ 50 days or occurs on 2 consecutive cycles, assess a marrow aspirate for remission status.  In the case of molecular remission, resume TRISENOX and tretinoin at 1 dose level lower (see Table 3 below).

Do not save any unused portions for later administration.  After dilution, TRISENOX is chemically and physically stable when stored for 24 hours at room temperature and 48 hours when refrigerated.  Administration  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  Administer TRISENOX intravenously over 2 hours. The infusion duration may be extended up to 4 hours if acute vasomotor reactions are observed. A central venous catheter is not required.  The TRISENOX vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Unused portions of each vial should be discarded properly. Do not mix TRISENOX with other medications.  Safe Handling Procedures  TRISENOX is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  TRISENOX is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to arsenic.  Hypersensitivity to arsenic. ( 4 ) </Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Hepatotoxicity: Grade ≥3 elevations in hepatic transaminase elevation have occurred in patients with newly diagnosed low or intermediate risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin. Monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during TRISENOX therapy. ( 5.3 )  Carcinogenesis: Arsenic trioxide is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. ( 5.4 )  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 )   5.1 Differentiation Syndrome  Differentiation syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with TRISENOX.  In clinical trials, 16-23% of patients treated with TRISENOX for APL developed differentiation syndrome.  Symptoms include unexplained fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, weight gain, peripheral edema, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy and multi-organ dysfunction.  Differentiation syndrome has been observed with and without concomitant hyperleukocytosis, and it has occurred as early as day 1 of induction to as late as the second month induction therapy. When TRISENOX is used in combination with tretinoin, prednisone prophylaxis is advised [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )].  At the first signs of differentiation syndrome, interrupt treatment with TRISENOX and administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice daily.  Continue high-dose steroids until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] .  5.2 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities  Patients treated with TRISENOX can develop QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, and complete heart block.  In the clinical trials of patients with newly-diagnosed low-risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin, 11% experienced QTc prolongation &gt; 450 msec for men and &gt; 460 msec for women throughout the treatment cycles. In the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory APL treated with TRISENOX monotherapy, 40% had at least one ECG tracing with a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. A prolonged QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after start of TRISENOX infusion, and it usually resolved by 8 weeks after TRISENOX infusion. There are no data on the effect of TRISENOX on the QTc interval during the infusion of the drug.  The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QTc prolongation, concomitant administration of QTc prolonging drugs, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QTc interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The risk may be increased when TRISENOX is coadministered with medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] .  Prior to initiating therapy with TRISENOX, assess the QTc interval by electrocardiogram, correct pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval.   Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTc.  If possible, discontinue drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. If it is not possible to discontinue the interacting drug, perform cardiac monitoring frequently [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. During TRISENOX therapy, maintain potassium concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL.  Monitor ECG weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable patients.   For patients who develop a QTc greater than 500 msec, immediately withhold treatment with TRISENOX and any medication known to prolong the QTc interval.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities. When the QTc normalizes, resume TRISENOX at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] .   5.3 Hepatotoxicity  In the clinical trials, 44% of patients with newly-diagnosed low-risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin experienced elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and/or serum bilirubin.  These abnormalities resolved with temporary discontinuation of TRISENOX and/or tretinoin.  During treatment with TRISENOX, monitor liver chemistries at least 2-3 times per week through recovery from toxicities.  Withhold treatment with TRISENOX and/or tretinoin if elevations in AST), alkaline phosphatase, and/or serum bilirubin occur to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] .  Long-term liver abnormalities can occur in APL patients treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin.  In a published series, mild liver dysfunction and hepatic steatosis were seen in 15% and 43%, respectively, of patients at a median of 7 years (range 0-14 years) after treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with tretinoin.  5.4 Carcinogenesis  The active ingredient of TRISENOX, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.  5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  TRISENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis. A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m² basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m² basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TRISENOX [see  Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Drugs That Can Prolong the QT/QTc Interval  Concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX may increase the risk of serious QT/QTc interval prolongation. Discontinue or replace with an alternative drug that does not prolong the QT/QTc interval while patient is using TRISENOX. Monitor ECGs more frequently in patients when it is not feasible to avoid concomitant use.  Drugs That Can Lead to Electrolyte Abnormalities  Electrolyte abnormalities increase the risk of serious QT/QTc interval prolongation. Avoid concomitant administration of drugs that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Monitor electrolytes more frequently in patients who must receive concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX.  Drugs That Can Lead to Hepatotoxicity  Concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX, particularly when given in combination with tretinoin, may increase the risk of serious hepatotoxicity. Discontinue or replace with an alternative drug that does not cause hepatotoxicity while the patient is using TRISENOX. Monitor liver function tests more frequently in patients when it is not feasible to avoid concomitant use. </Section>
