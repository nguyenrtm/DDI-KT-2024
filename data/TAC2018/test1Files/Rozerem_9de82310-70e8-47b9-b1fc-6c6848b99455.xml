<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported. Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur. ( 5.1 )  Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses: Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of treatment. ( 5.2 )  Abnormal thinking, behavioral changes, complex behaviors: May include "sleep-driving" and hallucinations. Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes. ( 5.3 )  Depression: Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur. ( 5.3 )  CNS effects: Potential impairment of activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, after ingesting the drug. ( 5.4 )  Reproductive effects: Include decreased testosterone and increased prolactin levels. Effect on reproductive axis in developing humans is unknown. ( 5.5 )  Patients with severe sleep apnea: Rozerem is not recommended for use in this population. ( 5.6 )  5.1 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions  Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ROZEREM. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with ROZEREM should not be rechallenged with the drug.  5.2 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses  Since sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia, or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities, may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and requires further evaluation of the patient. Exacerbation of insomnia and emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities were seen with ROZEREM during the clinical development program .  5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes  A variety of cognitive and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression (including suicidal ideation and completed suicides) has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics.  Hallucinations, as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and mania have been reported with ROZEREM use. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may also occur unpredictably.  Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with hypnotic use. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Complex behaviors have been reported with the use of ROZEREM. Discontinuation of ROZEREM should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior.  5.4 CNS Effects  Patients should avoid engaging in hazardous activities that require concentration (such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery) after taking ROZEREM.  After taking ROZEREM, patients should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for bed.  Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with ROZEREM as alcohol and ROZEREM may have additive effects when used in conjunction.  5.5 Reproductive Effects  Use in Adolescents and Children  ROZEREM has been associated with an effect on reproductive hormones in adults, e.g., decreased testosterone levels and increased prolactin levels. It is not known what effect chronic or even chronic intermittent use of ROZEREM may have on the reproductive axis in developing humans [see Clinical Trials (14.3) ].  5.6 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness  ROZEREM has not been studied in subjects with severe sleep apnea and is not recommended for use in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] .  ROZEREM should not be used by patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) ] .  5.7 Laboratory Tests  Monitoring  No standard monitoring is required.  For patients presenting with unexplained amenorrhea, galactorrhea, decreased libido, or problems with fertility, assessment of prolactin levels and testosterone levels should be considered as appropriate.  Interference with Laboratory Tests  ROZEREM is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests. In addition, in vitro data indicate that ramelteon does not cause false-positive results for benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methods in vitro .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer): Decreases exposure to and effects of ramelteon. ( 7.1 )  Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor): Increases AUC for ramelteon; administer with caution. ( 7.1 )  Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor): Increases systemic exposure of ramelteon; administer with caution. ( 7.1 )  Donepezil increases systemic exposure of ramelteon; patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon is coadministered with donepezil. ( 7.1 )  Doxepin increases systemic exposure of ramelteon; patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon is coadministered with doxepin. ( 7.1 )  Alcohol: Causes additive psychomotor impairment; should not be used in combination. ( 7.2 )  7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on ROZEREM  Fluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor): AUC 0-inf for ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the C max increased approximately 70-fold upon coadministration of fluvoxamine and ROZEREM, compared to ROZEREM administered alone. ROZEREM should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. ROZEREM should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors.  Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer): Administration of multiple doses of rifampin resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II. Efficacy may be reduced when ROZEREM is used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] .  Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor): The AUC 0-inf and C max of ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36% upon coadministration of ketoconazole with ROZEREM. ROZEREM should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] .  Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor): The AUC 0-inf and C max of ramelteon was increased by approximately 150% when ROZEREM was coadministered with fluconazole. ROZEREM should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] .  Donepezil:  The AUC 0-inf and C max of ramelteon increased by approximately 100% and 87%, respectively upon coadministration of donepezil with ROZEREM. Patients should be closely monitored when ROZEREM is coadministered with donepezil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] .  Doxepin:  The AUC 0-inf and C max of ramelteon increased by approximately 66% and 69%, respectively, upon coadministration of doxepin with ROZEREM. Patients should be closely monitored when ROZEREM is coadministered with doxepin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] .  7.2 Effect of Alcohol on ROZEREM  Alcohol by itself impairs performance and can cause sleepiness. Since the intended effect of ROZEREM is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ROZEREM [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Use of the products in combination may have an additive effect.  7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  ROZEREM is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests. In addition, in vitro data indicate that ramelteon does not cause false-positive results for benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methods in vitro .</Section>
