WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products), including VYVANSE, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) , and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 , 9.3) ].  WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products), including VYVANSE, have a high potential for abuse and dependence ( 5.1 , 9.2 , 9.3 )  Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy ( 5.1 , 9.2 )</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Indication  Initial Dose  Titration Schedule  Recommended Dose  Maximum Dose  ADHD (Adult and Pediatric patients) ( 2.2 )  30 mg every morning  10 mg or 20 mg weekly  30 mg to 70 mg per day  70 mg per day  BED (Adult patients) ( 2.3 )  30 mg every morning  20 mg weekly  50 mg to 70 mg per day  70 mg per day  Prior to treatment, assess for presence of cardiac disease ( 2.4 )  Severe renal impairment: Maximum dose is 50 mg/day ( 2.5 )  End stage renal disease (ESRD): Maximum dose is 30 mg/day ( 2.5 )  2.1 Pre-treatment Screening  Prior to treating children, adolescents, and adults with CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (e.g., a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  To reduce the abuse of CNS stimulants including VYVANSE, assess the risk of abuse, prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and re-evaluate the need for VYVANSE use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 , 9.3) ] .  2.2 General Instructions for Use  Take VYVANSE by mouth in the morning with or without food; avoid afternoon doses because of the potential for insomnia. VYVANSE may be administered in one of the following ways:  Information for VYVANSE capsules:  Swallow VYVANSE capsules whole, or  Open capsules, empty and mix the entire contents with yogurt, water, or orange juice. If the contents of the capsule include any compacted powder, a spoon may be used to break apart the powder. The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. Consume the entire mixture immediately . It should not be stored. The active ingredient dissolves completely once dispersed; however, a film containing the inactive ingredients may remain in the glass or container once the mixture is consumed.  Information for VYVANSE chewable tablets:  VYVANSE chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.  VYVANSE capsules can be substituted with VYVANSE chewable tablets on a unit per unit/ mg per mg basis (for example, 30 mg capsules for 30 mg chewable tablet) [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Do not take anything less than one capsule or chewable tablet per day. A single dose should not be divided.  2.3 Dosage for Treatment of ADHD  The recommended starting dose is 30 mg once daily in the morning in patients ages 6 and above. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 10 mg or 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals up to maximum dose of 70 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .  2.4 Dosage for Treatment of Moderate to Severe BED in Adults  The recommended starting dose is 30 mg/day to be titrated in increments of 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended target dose of 50 to 70 mg/day. The maximum dose is 70 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Discontinue VYVANSE if binge eating does not improve.  2.5 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment  In patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the maximum dose should not exceed 50 mg/day. In patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD, GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg/day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .  2.6 Dosage Modifications due to Drug Interactions  Agents that alter urinary pH can impact urinary excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust VYVANSE dosage accordingly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  VYVANSE is contraindicated in patients with:  Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or other ingredients of VYVANSE. Anaphylactic reactions, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, angioedema, and urticaria have been observed in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue), because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .  Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or other ingredients in VYVANSE ( 4 )  Use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of the last MAO inhibitor dose ( 4 , 7.2 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. In adults, sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, or coronary artery disease ( 5.2 )  Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. Consider benefits and risks before use in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic ( 5.3 )  Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychosis. Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to stimulant use ( 5.4 )  Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight in pediatric patients during treatment ( 5.5 )  Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants ( 5.6 )  Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue VYVANSE and initiate supportive treatment ( 4 , 5.7 , 10 ).  5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence  CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products), including VYVANSE, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 , 9.3) ] .  5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions  Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during VYVANSE treatment.  5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases  CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension.  5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions  Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis  CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.  Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder  CNS stimulants may induce a mixed/manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).  New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms  CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing VYVANSE. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients.  5.5 Suppression of Growth  CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of VYVANSE in patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the VYVANSE groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon  Stimulants, including VYVANSE, are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.  5.7 Serotonin Syndrome  Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives are known to be metabolized, to some degree, by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and display minor inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] . The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with the co-administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors which may increase the risk with increased exposure to the active metabolite of VYVANSE (dextroamphetamine). In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  Concomitant use of VYVANSE with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  Discontinue treatment with VYVANSE and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. Concomitant use of VYVANSE with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If clinically warranted, consider initiating VYVANSE with lower doses, monitoring patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and informing patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Acidifying and Alkalinizing Agents: Agents that alter urinary pH can alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents decrease amphetamine blood levels, while alkalinizing agents increase amphetamine blood levels. Adjust VYVANSE dosage accordingly ( 2.6 , 7.1 )  7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Amphetamines  Table 5 Drugs having clinically important interactions with amphetamines.  MAO Inhibitors (MAOI)  Clinical Impact  MAOI antidepressants slow amphetamine metabolism, increasing amphetamines effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings causing headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. Toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.  Intervention  Do not administer VYVANSE during or within 14 days following the administration of MAOI [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  Examples  selegiline, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine  Serotonergic Drugs  Clinical Impact  The concomitant use of VYVANSE and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Intervention  Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during VYVANSE initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue VYVANSE and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] .  Examples  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort  CYP2D6 Inhibitors  Clinical Impact  The concomitant use of VYVANSE and CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the exposure of dextroamphetamine, the active metabolite of VYVANSE compared to the use of the drug alone and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Intervention  Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome particularly during VYVANSE initiation and after a dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue VYVANSE and the CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Overdosage (10) ] .  Examples  paroxetine and fluoxetine (also serotonergic drugs), quinidine, ritonavir  Alkalinizing Agents  Clinical Impact  Urinary alkalinizing agents can increase blood levels and potentiate the action of amphetamine.  Intervention  Co-administration of VYVANSE and urinary alkalinizing agents should be avoided.  Examples  Urinary alkalinizing agents (e.g. acetazolamide, some thiazides).  Acidifying Agents  Clinical Impact  Urinary acidifying agents can lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.  Intervention  Increase dose based on clinical response.  Examples  Urinary acidifying agents (e.g., ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, methenamine salts).  Tricyclic Antidepressants  Clinical Impact  May enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents causing striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.  Intervention  Monitor frequently and adjust or use alternative therapy based on clinical response.  Examples  desipramine, protriptyline  7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with VYVANSE  From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of VYVANSE is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. In addition, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is needed when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g. atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .</Section>
