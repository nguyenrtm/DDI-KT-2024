Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs  Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) is not approved for use in pediatric patients. (See  Warnings: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ,  Precautions: Information for Patients, and  Precautions: Pediatric Use. )</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
CONTRAINDICATIONS  The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with PEXEVA® or within 14 days of stopping treatment with PEXEVA® is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of PEXEVA® within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated (see  WARNINGS and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting PEXEVA® in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see  WARNINGS and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Concomitant use in patients taking thioridazine is contraindicated (see  WARNINGS and  PRECAUTIONS ). Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated (see  PRECAUTIONS ). PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) tablets are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to paroxetine or any of the inactive ingredients in PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) tablets.</Section>

WARNINGS  Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.  The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in  Table 1 . TABLE 1  Age Range  Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases  of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo  &lt;18  14 additional cases  18-24  5 additional cases  Decreases Compared to Placebo  25-64  1 fewer case  ≥65  6 fewer cases  No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.  It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, ie, beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.  Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.  If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see  PRECAUTIONS and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION—Discontinuation of Treatment with PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate ), for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate)). Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  Prescriptions for PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:  A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including PEXEVA®, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.  The concomitant use of PEXEVA® with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. PEXEVA® should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking PEXEVA®. PEXEVA® should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If concomitant use of PEXEVA® with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, be aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.  Treatment with PEXEVA® and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.  Angle-Closure Glaucoma  The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Pexeva may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.  Potential Interaction with Thioridazine  Thioridazine administration alone produces prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. This effect appears to be dose-related.  An  in vivo  study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as paroxetine, will elevate plasma levels of thioridazine. Therefore, it is recommended that paroxetine not be used in combination with thioridazine (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS and  PRECAUTIONS ). Usage in Pregnancy  Teratogenic Effects:  Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below: A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery.  A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8).  Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants).  Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) included a total of 20 distinct studies: 11 studies (including the above noted studies) reported estimates for both cardiovascular defects and overall congenital malformations, 3 studies reported estimates only for cardiovascular defects, and 6 studies reported estimates only for overall congenital malformations. While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations contributed to all cardiovascular malformations.  If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see  PRECAUTIONS—Discontinuation of Treatment With PEXEVA® ). For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options. Animal Findings:  Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the MRHD on an mg/m2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects: Neonates exposed to PEXEVA® and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see  WARNINGS: Serotonin Syndrome ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including PEXEVA®) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association.  Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy.  When treating a pregnant woman with PEXEVA®, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and  ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Reports ).</Section>
<Section name="PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="42232-9">
PRECAUTIONS  General  Activation of Mania/Hypomania:  During premarketing testing, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1.0% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. In a subset of patients classified as bipolar, the rate of manic episodes was 2.2% for paroxetine and 11.6% for the combined active-control groups. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of MDD, paroxetine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Seizures:  During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.1% of paroxetine-treated patients, a rate similar to that associated with other drugs effective in the treatment of MDD. Paroxetine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures. It should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. Discontinuation of Treatment with  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate): Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications for paroxetine employed a taper-phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper-phase regimen used in GAD and PTSD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped. With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine at an incidence at least twice that reported for placebo: abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness. In the majority of patients, these events were mild to moderate and were self-limiting and did not require medical intervention.  During marketing of paroxetine and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon the discontinuation of these drugs (particularly when abrupt), including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, paresthesias such as electric shock sensations and tinnitus), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.  Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with paroxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see  DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). See also  PRECAUTIONS—Pediatric Use  for adverse events reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. Tamoxifen:  Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see  Drug Interactions ). However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the co-administration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. Akathisia:  The use of paroxetine or other SSRIs has been associated with the development of akathisia, which is characterized by an inner sense of restlessness and psychomotor agitation such as an inability to sit or stand still usually associated with subjective distress. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. Hyponatremia:  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate). In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see  Geriatric Use ). Discontinuation of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.  Abnormal Bleeding:  SSRIs and SNRIs, including PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate), may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.  Bone Fracture:  Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk following exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. The possibility of a pathological fracture, that is, a fracture produced by minimal trauma in a patient with decreased bone mineral density, should be considered in patients treated with paroxetine who present with unexplained bone pain, point tenderness, swelling, or bruising. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness:  Clinical experience with paroxetine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using paroxetine in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Paroxetine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. Evaluation of electrocardiograms of 682 patients who received paroxetine in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, did not indicate that paroxetine is associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Similarly, paroxetine does not cause any clinically important changes in heart rate or blood pressure.  Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose should be used in such patients (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Information for Patients  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should not be chewed or crushed, and should be swallowed whole.  Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of paroxetine and triptans, tramadol, or other serotonergic agents.  Patients should be advised that taking Pexeva can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.  Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient  Medication Guide  about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate). The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the  Medication Guide  and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the  Medication Guide  and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the  Medication Guide  is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate).  Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk:  Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.):  Patients should be cautioned about concomitant use of paroxetine with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since the combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance:  Any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Although in controlled studies paroxetine has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that paroxetine therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Completing Course of Therapy:  While patients may notice improvement with paroxetine therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed. Concomitant Medication:  Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:  Although paroxetine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate). Pregnancy:  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy (see  WARNINGS—Usage in Pregnancy: Teratogenic  and  Nonteratogenic Effects ). Nursing:  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast-feeding an infant (see  PRECAUTIONS—Nursing Mothers ). Laboratory Tests  There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.  Paxil® (paroxetine hydrochloride)  Paroxetine, the active ingredient in PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate), is also the active ingredient of Paxil®. Thus, these two agents should not be coadministered.  Drug Interactions  Tryptophan:  As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are coadministered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of headache, nausea, sweating, and dizziness, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking paroxetine. Consequently, concomitant use of paroxetine with tryptophan is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  WARNINGS . Pimozide:  In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after paroxetine was titrated to 60 mg daily, coadministration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and C max of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C max is due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine is contraindicated (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Serotonergic Drugs:  Based on the mechanism of action of paroxetine and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when paroxetine is coadministered with other drugs or agents that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, fentanyl, tramadol, amphetamines, or St. John's Wort (see  WARNINGS—Serotonin Syndrome ). The concomitant use of paroxetine with other SSRIs, SNRIs, or tryptophan is not recommended (see  PRECAUTIONS—Drug Interactions, Tryptophan  ). Thioridazine:  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS and  WARNINGS . Warfarin:  Preliminary data suggest that there may be a pharmacodynamic interaction (that causes an increased bleeding diathesis in the face of unaltered prothrombin time) between paroxetine and warfarin. Since there is little clinical experience, the concomitant administration of paroxetine and warfarin should be undertaken with caution (see  PRECAUTIONS: Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis ). Triptans:  There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with the use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant use of paroxetine with a triptan is warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see  WARNINGS—Serotonin Syndrome ). Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism:  The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Cimetidine—  Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. In a study where paroxetine (30 mg qd) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during coadministration with oral cimetidine (300 mg tid) for the final week. Therefore, when these drugs are administered concurrently, dosage adjustment of paroxetine after the 20 mg starting dose should be guided by clinical effect. The effect of paroxetine on cimetidine's pharmacokinetics was not studied. Phenobarbital—  Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30 mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg qd for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T 1/2 were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial paroxetine dosage adjustment is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect. Phenytoin—  When a single oral 30 mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg qd for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T 1/2 were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300 mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg qd for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when these drugs are coadministered; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS—Postmarketing Reports ). Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6:  Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of MDD (paroxetine, other SSRIs, and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (&gt;90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during paroxetine dosing. In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine (20 mg qd) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) C max , AUC, and T 1/2 by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate, has also been evaluated. In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine C max values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when it is given with paroxetine. Concomitant use of paroxetine with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either paroxetine or the other drug.  Therefore, coadministration of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of MDD (eg, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (eg, propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (eg, quinidine), should be approached with caution.  However, due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine, and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS and  WARNINGS ). Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see  PRECAUTIONS ). At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450 isozymes, which, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see  PRECAUTIONS—Tricyclic Antidepressants ). Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4:  An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine's in vitro K i and its lack of effect on terfenadine's in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other 3A4 substrates, paroxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA):  Caution is indicated in the coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate), because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is coadministered with PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate). (See  PRECAUTIONS—Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6 ). Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein:  Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs. Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin):  Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) is initiated or discontinued. Alcohol—  Although paroxetine does not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate). Lithium—  A multiple-dose study has shown that there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between paroxetine and lithium carbonate. However, due to the potential for serotonin syndrome, the concurrent administration of paroxetine and lithium should be undertaken with caution. Digoxin—  The steady-state pharmacokinetics of paroxetine was not altered when administered with digoxin at steady state. Mean digoxin AUC at steady state decreased by 15% in the presence of paroxetine. Since there is little clinical experience, the concurrent administration of paroxetine and digoxin should be undertaken with caution. Diazepam—  Under steady-state conditions, diazepam does not appear to affect paroxetine kinetics. The effects of paroxetine on diazepam were not evaluated. Procyclidine—  Daily oral dosing of paroxetine (30 mg qd) increased steady-state AUC 0-24 , C max , and C min values of procyclidine (5 mg oral qd) by 35%, 37%, and 67%, respectively, compared to procyclidine alone at steady state. If anticholinergic effects are seen, the dose of procyclidine should be reduced. Beta-Blockers—  In a study where propranolol (80 mg bid) was dosed orally for 18 days, the established steady-state plasma concentrations of propranolol were unaltered during coadministration with paroxetine (30 mg qd) for the final 10 days. The effects of propranolol on paroxetine have not been evaluated (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS—Postmarketing Reports ). Theophylline—  Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir—  Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy). Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)—  There are no clinical studies of the combined use of ECT and paroxetine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  Carcinogenesis:  Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to 2.4 (mouse) and 3.9 (rat) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for MDD and GAD on a mg/m2 basis. Because the MRHD for MDD is slightly less than that for OCD (50 mg vs 60 mg), the doses used in these carcinogenicity studies were only 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD for OCD. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis:  Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5  in vitro and 2  in vivo assays that included the following: bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations  in vivo in mouse bone marrow and  in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility:  Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men. A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2.9 times the MRHD for MDD and GAD or 2.4 times the MRHD for OCD on a mg/m2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (9.8 and 4.9 times the MRHD for MDD and GAD; 8.2 and 4.1 times the MRHD for OCD and PD on a mg/m2 basis).  Pregnancy  Pregnancy Category D (see  WARNINGS—Usage in Pregnancy: Teratogenic  and  Nonteratogenic Effects ). Labor and Delivery  The effect of paroxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.  Nursing Mothers  Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk, and caution should be exercised when PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) is administered to a nursing woman.  Pediatric Use  Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see  BOX WARNING and  WARNINGS—Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with paroxetine, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of paroxetine mesylate in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as PEXEVA®. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse events were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation.  Events reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients who received paroxetine and which occurred at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain (see  Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine ). Geriatric Use  SSRIs and SNRIs, including PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate), have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (See  PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia ). In worldwide premarketing paroxetine clinical trials, 17% of paroxetine-treated patients (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; there were, however, no overall differences in the adverse event profile between elderly and younger patients, and effectiveness was similar in younger and older patients (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Major Depressive Disorder  Usual Initial Dosage:  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of MDD. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of MDD, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20 mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10 mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Maintenance Therapy:  There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of MDD require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown. Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of paroxetine has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Usual Initial Dosage:  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10 mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day. Maintenance Therapy:  Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with OCD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). OCD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Panic Disorder  Usual Initial Dosage:  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The target dose of paroxetine in the treatment of PD is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 10 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day. Maintenance Therapy:  Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with PD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). PD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Usual Initial Dosage:  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day. The recommended starting dosage and the established effective dosage is 20 mg/day. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest a greater benefit to doses higher than 20 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. Maintenance Therapy:  Systematic evaluation of continuing paroxetine for periods of up to 24 weeks in patients with GAD who had responded while taking paroxetine during an 8-week acute treatment phase has demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY—Clinical Trials ). Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Special Populations  Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester:  Neonates exposed to paroxetine and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see  PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Dosage for Elderly or Debilitated, and Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment  : The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day. Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders:  At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with PEXEVA®. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping PEXEVA® before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of PEXEVA® With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue:  Do not start PEXEVA® in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In some cases, a patient already receiving PEXEVA® therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, PEXEVA® should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with PEXEVA® may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see  WARNINGS ). The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with PEXEVA® is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see  WARNINGS ). Discontinuation of Treatment with  PEXEVA® (paroxetine mesylate): Symptoms associated with discontinuation of paroxetine have been reported (see  PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which paroxetine is being prescribed. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</Section>
