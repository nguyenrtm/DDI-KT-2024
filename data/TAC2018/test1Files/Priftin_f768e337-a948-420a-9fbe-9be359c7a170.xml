<Text><Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Active pulmonary tuberculosis : PRIFTIN should be used in regimens consisting of an initial 2 month phase followed by a 4 month continuation phase. ( 2.1 )  Initial phase (2 Months): 600 mg twice weekly for two months as directly observed therapy (DOT), with no less than 72 hours between doses, in combination with other anti- tuberculosis drugs. ( 2.1 )  Continuation phase (4 Months): 600 mg once-weekly for 4 months as directly observed therapy with isoniazid or another appropriate anti- tuberculosis agent. ( 2.1 )  Latent tuberculosis infection : PRIFTIN should be administered in combination with isoniazid once-weekly for 12 weeks as directly observed therapy. Adults and children ≥ 12 years: PRIFTIN (based on weight, see table below) and isoniazid 15 mg/kg (900 mg maximum) Children 2–11 years: PRIFTIN (based on weight, see table below) and isoniazid 25 mg/kg (900 mg maximum)  Weight range  PRIFTIN dose  Number of PRIFTIN tablets  10–14 kg  300 mg  2  14.1–25 kg  450 mg  3  25.1– 32 kg  600 mg  4  32.1–50 kg  750 mg  5  &gt; 50 kg  900 mg  6  For Latent Tuberculosis Infection, the maximum recommended dose of PRIFTIN is 900 mg once-weekly for 12 weeks.  Take with food. Tablets may be crushed and added to semi-solid food.( 2.3 )  2.1 Dosage in Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis  PRIFTIN is only recommended for the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis caused by drug-susceptible organisms as part of regimens consisting of a 2 month initial phase followed by a 4 month continuation phase.  PRIFTIN should not be used in the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis caused by rifampin-resistant strains.  Initial phase (2 Months): PRIFTIN should be administered at a dose of 600 mg twice weekly for two months as directly observed therapy (DOT) , with an interval of no less than 3 consecutive days (72 hours) between doses, in combination with other anti- tuberculosis drugs as part of an appropriate regimen which includes daily companion drugs such as isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA).  Continuation phase (4 Months): Following the initial phase (2 months), continuation phase (4 months) treatment consists of PRIFTIN 600 mg once-weekly for 4 months in combination with isoniazid or another appropriate anti- tuberculosis agent for susceptible organisms administered as directly observed therapy.  2.2 Dosage in Latent Tuberculosis Infection  PRIFTIN should be administered once-weekly in combination with isoniazid for 12 weeks as directly observed therapy.  Adults and children 12 years and older: The recommended dose of PRIFTIN should be determined based on weight of the patient up to a maximum of 900 mg once-weekly (see Table 1 ). The recommended dose of isoniazid is 15 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest 50 mg or 100mg) up to a maximum of 900 mg once-weekly for 12 weeks.  Children 2–11 years: The recommended dose of PRIFTIN should be determined based on weight of the patient up to a maximum of 900 mg once- weekly (see Table 1 ). The recommended dose of isoniazid is 25 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest 50 mg or 100mg) up to a maximum of 900 mg once-weekly for 12 weeks.  Table 1: Weight based dose of PRIFTIN in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection  Weight range  PRIFTIN dose  Number of PRIFTIN tablets  10–14 kg  300 mg  2  14.1–25 kg  450 mg  3  25.1– 32 kg  600 mg  4  32.1–50 kg  750 mg  5  &gt; 50 kg  900 mg  6  2.3 Administration  Take PRIFTIN with meals. Administration of PRIFTIN with a meal increases oral bioavailability and may reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and/or vomiting. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  For patients who cannot swallow tablets, the tablets may be crushed and added to a small amount of semi-solid food, all of which should be consumed immediately [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  Known hypersensitivity to any rifamycin ( 4.1 )  4.1 Hypersensitivity  PRIFTIN is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifamycins.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Hepatotoxicity: Monitor for symptoms of liver injury and discontinue PRIFTIN if signs or symptoms or liver injury occur ( 5.1 )  Hypersensitivity: Discontinue PRIFTIN if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction occur. ( 5.2 ).  Relapse in the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis: Do not use as a once-weekly continuation phase regimen with isoniazid in HIV-infected patients. Monitor for signs or symptoms of relapse in patients with cavitary lesions or bilateral disease. ( 5.3 , 14.1 )  Drug Interactions: May interact with drugs metabolized by CYP450. ( 5.4 , 7.1 , 7.4 )  Discoloration of body fluids: May permanently stain contact lenses or dentures red-orange. ( 5.5 )  Clostridium difficile -associated colitis: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.6 )  Porphyria: Avoid use in patients with porphyria. ( 5.7 )  5.1 Hepatotoxicity  Elevations of liver transaminases may occur in patients receiving PRIFTIN [ see Adverse Reactions 6.1  ]. Patients on PRIFTIN should be monitored for symptoms of liver injury.  Patients with abnormal liver tests and/or liver disease or patients initiating treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis should only be given PRIFTIN in cases of necessity and under strict medical supervision. In such patients, obtain serum transaminase levels prior to therapy and every 2–4 weeks while on therapy. Discontinue PRIFTIN if evidence of liver injury occurs.  5.2 Hypersensitivity and Related Reactions  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients receiving PRIFTIN. Signs and symptoms of these reactions may include hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, acute bronchospasm, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or flu-like syndrome (weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, chills, aches, rash, itching, sweats, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, syncope, palpitations). There have been reports of anaphylaxis [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].  Monitor patients receiving PRIFTIN therapy for signs and/or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If these symptoms occur, administer supportive measures and discontinue PRIFTIN.  5.3 Relapse in the Treatment of Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis  PRIFTIN has not been evaluated as part of the initial phase treatment regimen in HIV-infected patients with active pulmonary TB.  Do not use PRIFTIN as a once-weekly continuation phase regimen in HIV-infected patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis because of a higher rate of failure and/or relapse with rifampin-resistant organisms [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].  Higher relapse rates may occur in patients with cavitary pulmonary lesions and/or positive sputum cultures after the initial phase of active tuberculosis treatment and in patients with evidence of bilateral pulmonary disease. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TB relapse in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].  Poor adherence to therapy is associated with high relapse rate. Emphasize the importance of compliance with therapy [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]  5.4 Drug Interactions  Rifapentine is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Concomitant use of rifapentine with other drugs metabolized by these enzymes, such as protease inhibitors, certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and hormonal contraception may cause a significant decrease in plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 , 7.3 and 7.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  5.5 Discoloration of Body Fluids  PRIFTIN may produce a red-orange discoloration of body tissues and/or fluids (e.g., skin, teeth, tongue, urine, feces, saliva, sputum, tears, sweat, and cerebrospinal fluid). Contact lenses or dentures may become permanently stained.  5.6 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea  Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including PRIFTIN, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile .  C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.  If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile if possible. Institute appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated .  5.7 Porphyria  Porphyria has been reported in patients receiving rifampin, attributed to induction of delta amino levulinic acid synthetase. Because PRIFTIN may have similar enzyme induction properties, avoid the use of PRIFTIN in patients with porphyria.</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Protease Inhibitors and Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors. ( 5.2 , 7.1 )  Hormonal Contraceptives: Use another means of birth control. ( 7.3 )  May increase metabolism and decrease the activity of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8/9. Dosage adjustments may be necessary if given concomitantly. ( 7.4 )  7.1 Protease Inhibitors and Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors  Rifapentine is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Concomitant use of PRIFTIN with other drugs metabolized by these enzymes, such as protease inhibitors and certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors, may cause a significant decrease in plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of the protease inhibitor or reverse transcriptase inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  7.2 Fixed Dose Combination of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir  Once-weekly co-administration of 900 mg PRIFTIN with the antiretroviral fixed dose combination of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate 300mg in HIV- infected patients did not result in any substantial change in steady state exposures of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. No clinically significant change in CD4 cell counts or viral loads were noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  7.3 Hormonal Contraceptives  PRIFTIN may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, patients using oral, transdermal patch, or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should be advised to change to non-hormonal methods of birth control.  7.4 Cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8/9  Rifapentine is an inducer of cytochromes P4503A4 and P4502C8/9. Therefore, PRIFTIN may increase the metabolism of other coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Induction of enzyme activities by PRIFTIN occurred within 4 days after the first dose. Enzyme activities returned to baseline levels 14 days after discontinuing PRIFTIN.  Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism and may reduce the activity of the following drugs; hence, PRIFTIN may also increase the metabolism and decrease the activity of these drugs. Dosage adjustments of the drugs in Table 4 or of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P4503A4 or P4502C8/9 may be necessary if they are given concurrently with PRIFTIN.  Table 4. Drug Interactions with PRIFTIN: Dosage Adjustment may be Necessary  Drug Class  Examples of Drugs Within Class  Antiarrhythmics  Disopyramide, mexiletine, quinidine, tocainide  Antibiotics  Chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, dapsone, doxycycline; Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin)  Oral Anticoagulants  Warfarin  Anticonvulsants  Phenytoin  Antimalarials  Quinine  Azole Antifungals  Fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole  Antipsychotics  Haloperidol  Barbiturates  Phenobarbital  Benzodiazepines  Diazepam  Beta-Blockers  Propanolol  Calcium Channel Blockers  Diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil  Cardiac Glycoside Preparations  Digoxin  Corticosteroids  Prednisone  Fibrates  Clofibrate  Oral Hypoglycemics  Sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide)  Hormonal Contraceptives/ Progestins  Ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel  Immunosuppressants  Cyclosporine, tacrolimus  Methylxanthines  Theophylline  Narcotic analgesics  Methadone  Phophodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors  Sildenafil  Thyroid preparations  Levothyroxine  Tricyclic antidepressants  Amitriptyline, nortriptyline  7.5 Other Interactions  The conversion of PRIFTIN to 25-desacetyl rifapentine is mediated by an esterase enzyme. There is minimal potential for PRIFTIN metabolism to be inhibited or induced by another drug, based upon the characteristics of the esterase enzymes.  Since PRIFTIN is highly bound to albumin, drug displacement interactions may also occur [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  7.6 Interactions with Laboratory Tests  Therapeutic concentrations of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and Vitamin B 12 . Similar drug-laboratory interactions should be considered for PRIFTIN; thus, alternative assay methods should be considered.</Section>
