( 2.3 )  • Hepatic Impairment: Recommended adjustments for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.4 )  Dosing Considerations  • LEXIVA tablets may be taken with or without food. ( 2.1 )  • LEXIVA suspension: Adults should take without food; pediatric patients should take with food. ( 2.1 )  2.1 General Dosing Information  LEXIVA tablets may be taken with or without food.  Adults should take LEXIVA oral suspension without food. Pediatric patients should take LEXIVA oral suspension with food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. If emesis occurs within 30 minutes after dosing, re-dosing of LEXIVA oral suspension should occur.  Higher-than-approved dose combinations of LEXIVA plus ritonavir are not recommended due to an increased risk of transaminase elevations [see Overdosage ( 10 )] .  When LEXIVA is used in combination with ritonavir, prescribers should consult the full prescribing information for ritonavir.  2.2 Adults  Therapy-Naive Adults  • LEXIVA 1,400 mg twice daily (without ritonavir).  • LEXIVA 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily.  • LEXIVA 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily.  o Dosing of LEXIVA 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily is supported by pharmacokinetic data [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .  • LEXIVA 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.  o Dosing of LEXIVA 700 mg twice daily plus 100 mg ritonavir twice daily is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .  Protease Inhibitor-Experienced Adults  • LEXIVA 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.  2.3 Pediatric Patients (Aged at Least 4 Weeks to 18 Years)  The recommended dosage of LEXIVA in patients aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years should be calculated based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose ( Table 1 ).

Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Score Ranging from 5 to 6)  LEXIVA should be used with caution at a reduced dosage of 700 mg twice daily without ritonavir (therapy-naive) or 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily (therapy-naive or protease inhibitor-experienced).  Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Score Ranging from 7 to 9)  LEXIVA should be used with caution at a reduced dosage of 700 mg twice daily without ritonavir (therapy-naive) or 450 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily (therapy-naive or protease inhibitor-experienced).  Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Score Ranging from 10 to 15)  LEXIVA should be used with caution at a reduced dosage of 350 mg twice daily without ritonavir (therapy-naive) or 300 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily (therapy-naive or protease inhibitor-experienced).  There are no data to support dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with hepatic impairment.</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  LEXIVA is contraindicated:  • in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to any of the components of this product or to amprenavir.  • when coadministered with drugs that are highly dependent on cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events ( Table 2 ).  Table 2. Drugs Contraindicated with LEXIVA (Information in the table applies to LEXIVA with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated.)  Drug Class/Drug Name  Clinical Comment  Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists:  Alfuzosin  Potentially increased alfuzosin concentrations can result in hypotension.

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  • The concomitant use of LEXIVA with ritonavir and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( 5.1 , 7.3 )  • LEXIVA should be discontinued for severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. ( 5.2 )  • LEXIVA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. ( 5.3 )  • Use of higher-than-approved doses may lead to transaminase elevations. Patients with hepatitis B or C are at increased risk of transaminase elevations. ( 5.4 )  • Patients receiving LEXIVA may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia ( 5.5 ), immune reconstitution syndrome ( 5.6 ), increase of body fat ( 5.7 ), and elevated triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations ( 5.8 ). Monitor cholesterol and triglycerides prior to therapy and periodically thereafter.  • Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported with amprenavir. ( 5.9 )  • Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additional factor VIII may be required. ( 5.10 )  • Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with fosamprenavir. ( 5.11 )  5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of LEXIVA/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving LEXIVA/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of LEXIVA/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:  • Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.  • Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of LEXIVA/ritonavir.  • Loss of therapeutic effect of LEXIVA/ritonavir and possible development of resistance.  See Table 7 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with LEXIVA/ritonavir; review concomitant medications during therapy with LEXIVA/ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] .  5.2 Skin Reactions  Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among 700 subjects treated with LEXIVA in clinical trials. Treatment with LEXIVA should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] .  5.3 Sulfa Allergy  LEXIVA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In a clinical trial of LEXIVA used as the sole protease inhibitor, rash occurred in 2 of 10 subjects (20%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 subjects (33%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. In 2 clinical trials of LEXIVA plus low-dose ritonavir, rash occurred in 8 of 50 subjects (16%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 subjects (12%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy.  5.4 Hepatic Toxicity  Use of LEXIVA with ritonavir at higher-than-recommended dosages may result in transaminase elevations and should not be used [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Overdosage ( 10 )] . Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and patients should be monitored closely during treatment.  5.5 Diabetes/Hyperglycemia  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established.  5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including LEXIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  5.7 Increase in Body Fat  Increase of body fat has been observed in patients receiving protease inhibitors, including LEXIVA. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.8 Lipid Elevations  Treatment with LEXIVA plus ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] .  5.9 Hemolytic Anemia  Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir.  5.10 Patients with Hemophilia  There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.  5.11 Nephrolithiasis  Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving LEXIVA. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered.  5.12 Resistance/Cross-Resistance  Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect therapy with LEXIVA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. LEXIVA has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] .</Section>

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  See also Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) .  If LEXIVA is used in combination with ritonavir, see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions.  • Coadministration of LEXIVA with drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease amprenavir (active metabolite) concentrations leading to potential loss of virologic activity. ( 7 , 12.3 )  • Coadministration with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations. ( 7 , 12.3 )  • Coadministration of LEXIVA or LEXIVA and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. ( 7 )  • Coadministration of LEXIVA and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. ( 7 )  7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers  Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4.  Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects.  The potential for drug interactions with LEXIVA changes when LEXIVA is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir. The magnitude of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions (effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug) may change when LEXIVA is coadministered with ritonavir. Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with LEXIVA plus ritonavir.  There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .  7.2 Drugs that Should Not Be Coadministered with LEXIVA  See Contraindications ( 4 ).  7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions.
