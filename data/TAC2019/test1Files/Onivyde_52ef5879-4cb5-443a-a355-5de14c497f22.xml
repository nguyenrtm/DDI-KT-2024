<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ONIVYDE is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ONIVYDE or irinotecan HCl.  Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ONIVYDE or irinotecan HCl. ( 4 , 5.4 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal ILD has occurred in patients receiving irinotecan HCl. Discontinue ONIVYDE if ILD is diagnosed. ( 5.3 ) Severe hypersensitivity reaction: Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE for severe hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.4 ,  4 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.5 ,  8.1 ,  8.3 ) 5.1  Severe  Neutropenia  ONIVYDE can cause severe or life-threatening neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis. In Study 1, the incidence of fatal neutropenic sepsis was 0.8% among patients receiving ONIVYDE, occurring in one of 117 patients in the ONIVYDE plus fluorouracil/leucovorin (ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV) arm and one of 147 patients receiving ONIVYDE as a single agent. Severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV compared to 2% of patients receiving fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (5-FU/LV). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis occurred in 3% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, and did not occur in patients receiving 5-FU/LV.  In patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher among Asian patients [18 of 33 (55%)] compared to White patients [13 of 73 (18%)]. Neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian patients compared to 1% of White patients [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle and more frequently if clinically indicated. Withhold ONIVYDE if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1500/mm 3 or if neutropenic fever occurs. Resume ONIVYDE when the ANC   is 1500/mm 3 or above. Reduce ONIVYDE dose for Grade 3-4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever following recovery in subsequent cycles [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]. 5.2  Severe  Diarrhea  ONIVYDE can cause severe and life-threatening diarrhea. Do not administer ONIVYDE to patients with bowel obstruction.  Severe or life-threatening diarrhea followed one of two patterns: late onset diarrhea (onset more than 24 hours following chemotherapy) and early onset diarrhea (onset within 24 hours of chemotherapy, sometimes occurring with other symptoms of cholinergic reaction) [see  Cholinergic Reactions (6.1)  ]. An individual patient may experience both early and late-onset diarrhea. In Study 1, Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 13% receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV compared to 4% receiving 5-FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late onset diarrhea was 9% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, compared to 4% in patients receiving 5-FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea was 3% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, compared to no Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea in patients receiving 5-FU/LV. Of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV in Study 1, 34% received loperamide for late-onset diarrhea and 26% received atropine for early-onset diarrhea. Withhold ONIVYDE for Grade 2-4 diarrhea. Initiate loperamide for late onset diarrhea of any severity. Administer intravenous or subcutaneous atropine 0.25 to 1 mg (unless clinically contraindicated) for early onset diarrhea of any severity. Following recovery to Grade 1 diarrhea, resume ONIVYDE at a reduced dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]. 5.  3  Interstitial Lung Disease  Irinotecan HCl can cause severe and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD). Withhold ONIVYDE in patients with new or progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever, pending diagnostic evaluation. Discontinue ONIVYDE in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD.  5.  4  Severe Hypersensitivity  Reaction  Irinotecan HCl can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction.  5.  5  Embryo  -F  etal Toxicity  Based on animal data with irinotecan HCl and the mechanism of action of ONIVYDE, ONIVYDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed following treatment with irinotecan HCl, at doses resulting in irinotecan exposures lower than those achieved with ONIVYDE 70 mg/m 2 in humans, administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONIVYDE and for one month following the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  , 8.3  ),  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7  DRUG INTERACTIONS  Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers if possible. Substitute non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of ONIVYDE. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors, if possible; discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting therapy. ( 7.2 ) 7.  1  Strong CYP3A4 Inducers  Following administration of non-liposomal irinotecan (i.e., irinotecan HCl), exposure to irinotecan or its active metabolite, SN-38, is substantially reduced in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin and strong CYP3A4 inducers. Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort ) if possible. Substitute non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of ONIVYDE therapy [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]. 7.  2  Strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 Inhibitors  Following administration of non-liposomal irinotecan (i.e., irinotecan HCl), patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor, have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Co-administration of ONIVYDE with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) or UGT1A1 (e.g., atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN-38. Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors if possible. Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting ONIVYDE therapy  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ] .</Section>
