WARNING: QT PROLONGATION, TORSADES DE POINTES, AND SUDDEN DEATH  CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval. Torsades de pointes and sudden death have occurred in patients receiving CAPRELSA. Do not use CAPRELSA in patients with hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. Correct hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia prior to CAPRELSA administration. Monitor electrolytes periodically. Avoid drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the restricted distribution program are able to prescribe and dispense CAPRELSA [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.15)  ].  WARNING: QT PROLONGATION, TORSADES DE POINTES, AND SUDDEN DEATH  See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval. Torsades de pointes and sudden death have occurred in patients receiving CAPRELSA. Do not use CAPRELSA in patients with hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. Correct hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia prior to CAPRELSA administration. Monitor electrolytes periodically. Avoid drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the restricted distribution program are able to prescribe and dispense CAPRELSA ( 5.1 , 5.15 ).</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  The recommended dose of CAPRELSA is 300 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  CAPRELSA may be taken with or without food.  Do not take a missed dose within 12 hours of the next dose.  Do not crush CAPRELSA tablets. The tablets can be dispersed in 2 ounces of water by stirring for approximately 10 minutes (will not completely dissolve). Do not use other liquids for dispersion. Swallow immediately after dispersion. Mix any remaining residue with 4 additional ounces of water and swallow.  The dispersion can also be administered through nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes.  300 mg once daily. ( 2 )  CAPRELSA may be taken with or without food. ( 2 )  Dosage reduction may be necessary in the event of severe toxicities or QTc interval prolongation. ( 2.1 )  The starting dose is 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. ( 2.1 )  2.1 Dosage Adjustment  For adverse reactions  The 300 mg daily dose can be reduced to 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) and then to 100 mg for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or greater toxicities.  Interrupt CAPRELSA for the following:  Corrected QT interval, Fridericia (QTcF) greater than 500 ms: Resume at a reduced dose when the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms.  CTCAE Grade 3 or greater toxicity: Resume at a reduced dose when the toxicity resolves or improves to CTCAE Grade 1.  For recurrent toxicities, reduce the dose of CAPRELSA to 100 mg after resolution or improvement to CTCAE Grade 1 severity, if continued treatment is warranted.  Because of the 19-day half-life, adverse reactions including a prolonged QT interval may not resolve quickly. Monitor appropriately [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , (5.2),  (5.3),  (5.4),  (5.5),  (5.6),  (5.7) , and (5.9)  ].  For patients with renal impairment  Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance ≥30 to &lt;50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  For patients with hepatic impairment  CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Prolonged QT Interval, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death: Monitor electrocardiograms and levels of serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH. Reduce CAPRELSA dose as appropriate. ( 2.1 , 5.1 )  Severe skin reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some fatal. Discontinue CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions. ( 5.2 )  Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities: investigate unexplained non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA for confirmed ILD. ( 2.1 , 5.3 )  Ischemic cerebrovascular events, hemorrhage, heart failure, diarrhea, hypertension, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome: Discontinue or interrupt CAPRELSA. ( 2.1 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.8 , 5.9 , 5.10 )  Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy during and for four months following treatment with CAPRELSA. ( 5.14 , 8.1 )  REMS: CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. ( 5.15 )  5.1 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes  CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]. Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden deaths have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA.  Do not start CAPRELSA treatment in patients whose QTcF interval is greater than 450 ms. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure. CAPRELSA has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction. Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor QT interval frequently.  Obtain an ECG and serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH at baseline, 2–4 weeks and 8–12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. Monitor electrolytes and ECGs more frequently in patients who experience diarrhea. Following any dose reduction for QT prolongation or any dose interruption greater than 2 weeks, conduct QT assessments as described above. Maintain serum potassium levels of 4 mEq/L or higher (within normal range) and maintain serum magnesium and calcium levels within normal ranges to reduce the risk of QT prolongation.  Avoid using CAPRELSA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]. If such drugs are given to patients already receiving CAPRELSA and no alternative therapy exists, perform ECG monitoring of the QT interval more frequently.  Stop CAPRELSA in patients who develop a QTcF greater than 500 ms until the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. Dosing of CAPRELSA can then be resumed at a reduced dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  5.2 Severe Skin Reactions  Severe and sometimes fatal skin reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Permanently discontinue CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions and refer the patient for urgent medical evaluation. Systemic therapies such as corticosteroids may be required.  Photosensitivity reactions can occur during CAPRELSA treatment and up to 4 months after treatment discontinuation.  5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider a diagnosis of ILD in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms.  Interrupt CAPRELSA for acute or worsening pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA if ILD is confirmed.  5.4 Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events  Ischemic cerebrovascular events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. In the randomized medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study, ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred more frequently with CAPRELSA compared to placebo (1.3% compared to 0%). The safety of resumption of CAPRELSA therapy after resolution of an ischemic cerebrovascular event has not been studied. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients who experience a severe ischemic cerebrovascular event.  5.5 Hemorrhage  Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients with a recent history of hemoptysis of ≥1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients with severe hemorrhage.  5.6 Heart Failure  Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA in patients with heart failure. Heart failure may not be reversible upon stopping CAPRELSA.  5.7 Diarrhea  Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater severity occurred in 11% of patients receiving CAPRELSA in the randomized MTC study. If diarrhea occurs, carefully monitor serum electrolytes and ECGs to reduce the risk and enable early detection of QT prolongation resulting from dehydration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]. Interrupt CAPRELSA for severe diarrhea. Upon improvement, resume CAPRELSA at a reduced dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  5.8 Hypothyroidism  In the randomized MTC study in which 90% of the patients enrolled had prior thyroidectomy, increased dosing of thyroid replacement therapy was required in 49% of CAPRELSA-treated patients compared to 17% of placebo-treated patients. Obtain Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline, at 2–4 weeks and 8–12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. If signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism occur, examine thyroid hormone levels and adjust thyroid replacement therapy accordingly.  5.9 Hypertension  Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor all patients for hypertension. Dose reduction or interruption for hypertension may be necessary. If hypertension cannot be controlled, do not resume CAPRELSA [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider this syndrome in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. In clinical studies, three of four patients who developed RPLS while taking CAPRELSA also had hypertension. Discontinue CAPRELSA treatment in patients with RPLS.  5.11 Drug Interactions  Avoid administration of CAPRELSA with anti-arrhythmic drugs (including but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to chloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, and pimozide) [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  5.12 Renal Impairment  Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor the QT interval closely. There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [ see Boxed Warning  ,  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  5.13 Hepatic Impairment  CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  5.14 Embryofetal Toxicity  Based on its mechanism of action, CAPRELSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In nonclinical studies in rats, vandetanib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at exposures equivalent to or lower than those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day and had adverse effects on female fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development of pups.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy. Advise women of childbearing potential that they must use effective contraception during CAPRELSA treatment and for at least four months following the last dose of CAPRELSA [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , (8.8)  ].  5.15 CAPRELSA REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program  Because of the risk of QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death, CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the program are able to prescribe and dispense CAPRELSA.

<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS  Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers because they may decrease CAPRELSA exposure. ( 7.1 )  Avoid the use of agents that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.11 )  7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on CAPRELSA  Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased vandetanib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inducers during CAPRELSA therapy. Avoid concomitant use of St. John's Wort because it can decrease vandetanib exposure unpredictably [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.2 Effect of CAPRELSA on OCT2 Transporter  CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of metformin that is transported by the organic cation transporter type 2 (OCT2). Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with drugs that are transported by OCT2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.3 Effect of CAPRELSA on Digoxin  CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of digoxin. Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with digoxin [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  7.4 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval  Avoid concomitant use of CAPRELSA with agents that may prolong the QT interval [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ].</Section>
