2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Recommended Dosage ( 2.3 )  Infection  Loading dose  Maintenance Dose  IV  IV  Oral  Invasive Aspergillosis  6 mg/kg q12h for the first 24 hours  4 mg/kg q12h  200 mg q12h  Candidemia in nonneutropenics and other deep tissue Candida infections  3–4 mg/kg q12h  200 mg q12h  Scedosporiosis and Fusariosis  4 mg/kg q12h  200 mg q12h  Esophageal Candidiasis  Not Evaluated  not evaluated  200 mg q12h  Adult patients weighing less than 40 kg: oral maintenance dose 100 or 150 mg q12 hours  See full prescribing information for instructions on reconstitution of lyophilized powder for intravenous use and reconstitution of oral suspension and important administration instructions ( 2.5 , 2.6 )  2.1 Instructions for Use in All Patients  VFEND Tablets or Oral Suspension should be taken at least one hour before or after a meal.  VFEND I.V. for Injection requires reconstitution to 10 mg/mL and subsequent dilution to 5 mg/mL or less prior to administration as an infusion, at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour over 1 to 2 hours.  Do not administer as an IV bolus injection.  2.2 Use of VFEND I.V. With Other Parenteral Drug Products  Blood products and concentrated electrolytes  VFEND I.V. must not be infused concomitantly with any blood product or short-term infusion of concentrated electrolytes, even if the two infusions are running in separate intravenous lines (or cannulas). Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ].  Intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes  VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as other intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes, but must be infused through a separate line.  Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)  VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as total parenteral nutrition, but must be infused in a separate line. If infused through a multiple-lumen catheter, TPN needs to be administered using a different port from the one used for VFEND I.V.  2.3 Recommended Dosing in Adults  Invasive aspergillosis and serious fungal infections due to Fusarium spp. and Scedosporium apiospermum  See Table 1 . Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of intravenous VFEND on Day 1 followed by the recommended maintenance dose (RMD) regimen. Intravenous treatment should be continued for at least 7 days. Once the patient has clinically improved and can tolerate medication given by mouth, the oral tablet form or oral suspension form of VFEND may be utilized. The recommended oral maintenance dose of 200 mg achieves a voriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV; a 300 mg oral dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. Switching between the intravenous and oral formulations is appropriate because of the high bioavailability of the oral formulation in adults [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12)  ].  Candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and other deep tissue Candida infections  See Table 1 . Patients should be treated for at least 14 days following resolution of symptoms or following last positive culture, whichever is longer.  Esophageal Candidiasis  See Table 1 . Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following resolution of symptoms.  Table 1: Recommended Dosing Regimen  Infection  Loading dose  Maintenance Dose Increase dose when VFEND is co-administered with phenytoin or efavirenz ( 7 ); Decrease dose in patients with hepatic impairment ( 2.7 )  ,  In healthy volunteer studies, the 200 mg oral q12h dose provided an exposure (AUC τ ) similar to a 3 mg/kg IV q12h dose; the 300 mg oral q12h dose provided an exposure (AUC τ ) similar to a 4 mg/kg IV q12h dose [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12)  ].  IV  IV  Oral Adult patients who weigh less than 40 kg should receive half of the oral maintenance dose.  Invasive Aspergillosis In a clinical study of invasive aspergillosis, the median duration of IV VFEND therapy was 10 days (range 2–85 days). The median duration of oral VFEND therapy was 76 days (range 2–232 days) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  6 mg/kg q12h for the first 24 hours  4 mg/kg q12h  200 mg q12h  Candidemia in nonneutropenic patients and other deep tissue Candida infections  6 mg/kg q12h for the first 24 hours  3–4 mg/kg q12h In clinical trials, patients with candidemia received 3 mg/kg IV q12h as primary therapy, while patients with other deep tissue Candida infections received 4 mg/kg q12h as salvage therapy. Appropriate dose should be based on the severity and nature of the infection.  200 mg q12h  Esophageal Candidiasis  Not evaluated in patients with esophageal candidiasis.  200 mg q12h  Scedosporiosis and Fusariosis  6 mg/kg q12h for the first 24 hours  4 mg/kg q12h  200 mg q12h  2.4 Dosage Adjustment  If patient response is inadequate, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 200 mg every 12 hours (similar to 3 mg/kg IV q12h) to 300 mg every 12 hours (similar to 4 mg/kg IV q12h). For adult patients weighing less than 40 kg, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 100 mg every 12 hours to 150 mg every 12 hours. If patient is unable to tolerate 300 mg orally every 12 hours, reduce the oral maintenance dose by 50 mg steps to a minimum of 200 mg every 12 hours (or to 100 mg every 12 hours for adult patients weighing less than 40 kg).  If patient is unable to tolerate 4 mg/kg IV q12h, reduce the intravenous maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg q12h.  The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be increased when co-administered with phenytoin or efavirenz [ see Drug Interactions (7)  ].  The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be reduced in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh Class A and B [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ]. There are no PK data to allow for dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.  2.5 Intravenous Administration  Reconstitution  The powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of Water For Injection to obtain an extractable volume of 20 mL of clear concentrate containing 10 mg/mL of voriconazole. It is recommended that a standard 20 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount (19.0 mL) of Water for Injection is dispensed. Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Shake the vial until all the powder is dissolved.  Dilution  VFEND must be infused over 1–2 hours, at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or less. Therefore, the required volume of the 10 mg/mL VFEND concentrate should be further diluted as follows (appropriate diluents listed below):  Calculate the volume of 10 mg/mL VFEND concentrate required based on the patient's weight (see Table 2 ).  In order to allow the required volume of VFEND concentrate to be added, withdraw and discard at least an equal volume of diluent from the infusion bag or bottle to be used. The volume of diluent remaining in the bag or bottle should be such that when the 10 mg/mL VFEND concentrate is added, the final concentration is not less than 0.5 mg/mL nor greater than 5 mg/mL.  Using a suitable size syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw the required volume of VFEND concentrate from the appropriate number of vials and add to the infusion bag or bottle. Discard Partially Used Vials .  The final VFEND solution must be infused over 1–2 hours at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour.

Therefore, from a microbiological point of view, once reconstituted, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solutions without particles should be used.  The reconstituted solution can be diluted with:  9 mg/mL (0.9%) Sodium Chloride USP Lactated Ringers USP 5% Dextrose and Lactated Ringers USP 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride USP 5% Dextrose USP 5% Dextrose and 20 mEq Potassium Chloride USP 0.45% Sodium Chloride USP 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP  The compatibility of VFEND I.V. with diluents other than those described above is unknown (see Incompatibilities below).  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  Incompatibilities  VFEND I.V. must not be diluted with 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate Infusion. The mildly alkaline nature of this diluent caused slight degradation of VFEND after 24 hours storage at room temperature. Although refrigerated storage is recommended following reconstitution, use of this diluent is not recommended as a precautionary measure. Compatibility with other concentrations is unknown.  2.6 Oral Suspension  Reconstitution  Tap the bottle to release the powder. Add 46 mL of water to the bottle. Shake the closed bottle vigorously for about 1 minute. Remove child-resistant cap and push bottle adaptor into the neck of the bottle. Replace the cap. Write the date of expiration of the reconstituted suspension on the bottle label (the shelf-life of the reconstituted suspension is 14 days at controlled room temperature 15–30°C [59–86°F]).  Instructions for use  Shake the closed bottle of reconstituted suspension for approximately 10 seconds before each use. The reconstituted oral suspension should only be administered using the oral dispenser supplied with each pack.  Incompatibilities  VFEND for Oral Suspension and the 40 mg/mL reconstituted oral suspension should not be mixed with any other medication or additional flavoring agent. It is not intended that the suspension be further diluted with water or other vehicles.  2.7 Use in Patients With Hepatic Impairment  In the clinical program, patients were included who had baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) up to 5 times the upper limit of normal. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with this degree of abnormal liver function, but continued monitoring of liver function tests for further elevations is recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ].  It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  VFEND has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C disease. VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.  2.8 Use in Patients With Renal Impairment  The pharmacokinetics of orally administered VFEND are not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ].  Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  VFEND is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between VFEND (voriconazole) and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.  Coadministration of terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with sirolimus is contraindicated because VFEND significantly increases sirolimus concentrations [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg q24h or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg q12h) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg q12h) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg q12h) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with rifabutin is contraindicated since VFEND significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because VFEND may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Coadministration of VFEND with St. John's Wort is contraindicated because this herbal supplement may decrease voriconazole plasma concentration [ see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  Hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients ( 4 )  Coadministration with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine, sirolimus due to risk of serious adverse reactions ( 4 , 7 )  Coadministration with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, efavirenz, ritonavir, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids, and St. John's Wort due to risk of loss of efficacy ( 4 , 7 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Clinically Significant Drug Interactions : Review patient's concomitant medications ( 5.1 , 7 )  Hepatic Toxicity : Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy ( 5.2 )  Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days ( 5.3 )  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard ( 5.4 , 8.1 )  Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use ( 5.5 )  Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation : Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions ( 5.6 )  Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis) : Stop the infusion ( 5.7 )  Dermatological Reactions : Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity ( 5.13 )  Skeletal Events : Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur ( 5.14 )  5.1 Drug Interactions  See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [ see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)  ].  5.2 Hepatic Toxicity  In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with VFEND (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].  Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of VFEND therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, VFEND should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.7) , and Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].  5.3 Visual Disturbances  The effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ].  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.  5.5 Galactose Intolerance  VFEND tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.  5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation  Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes ), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.  Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:  Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation  Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present  Sinus bradycardia  Existing symptomatic arrhythmias  Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [ see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  5.7 Infusion Related Reactions  During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur.  5.8 Laboratory Tests  Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy.  Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).  5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment  It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving VFEND [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ].  VFEND has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.  5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment  In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)  ].  5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function  Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.  Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine.  5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function  Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during VFEND treatment.  5.13 Dermatological Reactions  Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued.  VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and VFEND discontinuation should be considered. If VFEND is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term VFEND therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued.  The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.  5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events  Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [ see Adverse Reactions (6.4)  ].</Section>

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary.  Methadone Results based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30–100 mg q24h) (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Increased  Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed  Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Increased  Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [ see Drug Interactions (7)  ]  Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Significantly Increased  Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [ see Drug Interactions (7)  ].  Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Significantly Increased  Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [ see Drug Interactions (7)  ].  NSAIDs Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug including. ibuprofen and diclofenac  Increased  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs. Dose reduction of NSAIDs may be needed [ see Drug Interactions (7)  ].  (CYP2C9 Inhibition)  Tacrolimus  (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Significantly Increased  When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving tacrolimus, reduce the tacrolimus dose to one-third of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, tacrolimus concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary.  Phenytoin  (CYP2C9 Inhibition)  Significantly Increased  Frequent monitoring of phenytoin plasma concentrations and frequent monitoring of adverse effects related to phenytoin.  Oral Contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Increased  Monitoring for adverse events related to oral contraceptives is recommended during coadministration.  Warfarin  (CYP2C9 Inhibition)  Prothrombin Time Significantly Increased  Monitor PT or other suitable anti-coagulation tests. Adjustment of warfarin dosage may be needed.  Omeprazole  (CYP2C19/3A4 Inhibition)  Significantly Increased  When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving omeprazole doses of 40 mg or greater, reduce the omeprazole dose by one-half. The metabolism of other proton pump inhibitors that are CYP2C19 substrates may also be inhibited by voriconazole and may result in increased plasma concentrations of other proton pump inhibitors.  Other HIV Protease Inhibitors (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  In Vivo Studies Showed No Significant Effects on Indinavir Exposure  No dosage adjustment for indinavir when coadministered with VFEND  In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure)  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to other HIV protease inhibitors  Other NNRTIs Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors  (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  A Voriconazole-Efavirenz Drug Interaction Study Demonstrated the Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism of Other NNRTIs (Increased Plasma Exposure)  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NNRTI  Benzodiazepines (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure)  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity (i.e., prolonged sedation) related to benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam). Adjustment of benzodiazepine dosage may be needed.  HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure)  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to statins. Increased statin concentrations in plasma have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. Adjustment of the statin dosage may be needed.  Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure)  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers. Adjustment of calcium channel blocker dosage may be needed.  Sulfonylurea Oral Hypoglycemics (CYP2C9 Inhibition)  Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro , but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased  Frequent monitoring of blood glucose and for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemic drug dosage may be needed.  Vinca Alkaloids (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro , but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased  Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity (i.e., neurotoxicity) related to vinca alkaloids. Reserve azole antifungals, including voriconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.  Everolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition)  Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro , but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased  Concomitant administration of voriconazole and everolimus is not recommended.  CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 inhibitors and inducers: Adjust VFEND dosage and monitor for adverse reactions or lack of efficacy ( 4 , 7 )  VFEND may increase the concentrations and activity of drugs that are CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates. Reduce dosage of these other drugs and monitor for adverse reactions ( 4 , 7 )  Phenytoin or Efavirenz: with co-administration, increase maintenance oral and intravenous dosage of VFEND ( 2.3 , 7 )</Section>
