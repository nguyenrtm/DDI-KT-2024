WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; and MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) INHIBITORS INTERACTIONS  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see WARNINGS ].  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection or following a dose increase [see WARNINGS ].  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  Prolonged use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see WARNINGS ].  Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction  The concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in meperidine plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in meperidine plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ].  Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ].  Reserve concomitant prescribing of meperidine hydrochloride and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  Concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  Concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can result in coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis and hypotension. Use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with MAO inhibitors within the last 14 days is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ].</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
CONTRAINDICATIONS  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with:  Significant respiratory depression [see  WARNINGS  ]  Acute of severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see  WARNINGS  ]  Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 14 days of having taken an MAOI [see  WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ]  Known of suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see  WARNINGS  ]  Hypersensitivity to meperidine.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS SECTION" id="34071-1">
WARNINGS  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection contains meperidine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ].  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, and monitor all patients receiving Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity.  Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  OVERDOSAGE  ]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection.  To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection are essential [see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ]. Overestimating the Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  Prolonged use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see  PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients , Pregnancy  ].  Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  Concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of meperidine and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see WARNINGS ], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection-treated patients may increase meperidine plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection until stable drug effects are achieved [ PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ].  Concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease meperidine plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to meperidine. When using Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [ PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ].  Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ].  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients  ].  Fatal Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or those who have recently received such agents. Therapeutic doses of meperidine have occasionally precipitated unpredictable, severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received such agents within 14 days. The mechanism of these reactions is unclear, but may be related to a preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia. Some have been characterized by coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension, and have resembled the syndrome of acute narcotic overdose. Serotonin syndrome with agitation, hyperthermia, diarrhea, tachycardia, sweating, tremors and impaired consciousness may also occur. In other reactions the predominant manifestations have been hyperexcitability, convulsions, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension.  Do not use Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.  Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisolone have been used to treat severe reactions, with the addition of intravenous chlorpromazine in those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia. The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of these reactions is unknown.  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  The use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection - treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection [see  WARNINGS  ] .  Elderly, Cachetic, or Debilitated Patients  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see  WARNINGS  ] .  Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and when Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  WARNINGS  ] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.  Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ]. This may occur within the recommended dosage range.  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  Adrenal Insufficiency  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.  Hypotensive Effect  The administration of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection may result in severe hypotension in the postoperative patient or any individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume or the administration of drugs such as the phenothiazines or certain anesthetics.  Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure  The respiratory depressant effects of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and its capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection must be used with extreme caution and only if its use is deemed essential.  Intravenous Use  See  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  .  Usage in Ambulatory Patients  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned accordingly.  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, like other narcotics, may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.  Usage in Pregnancy and Lactation  Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection should not be used in pregnant women prior to the labor period, unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards, because safe use in pregnancy prior to labor has not been established relative to possible adverse effects on fetal development.  When used as an obstetrical analgesic, meperidine crosses the placental barrier and can produce depression of respiration and psychophysiologic functions in the newborn. Resuscitation may be required [see  OVERDOSAGE  ].  Meperidine appears in the milk of nursing mothers receiving the drug.</Section>
<Section name="PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="42232-9">
PRECAUTIONS  Do not use unless solution is clear and package is undamaged [see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ].  General  Supraventricular Tachycardias  Meperidine should be used with caution in patients with atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias because of a possible vagolytic action which may produce a significant increase in the ventricular response rate.  Convulsions  Meperidine may aggravate pre-existing convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders. If dosage is escalated substantially above recommended levels because of tolerance development, convulsions may occur in individuals without a history of convulsive disorders. The convulsive potential of meperidine may be further increased if prolonged infusions or repeated doses are administered due to high serum levels of normeperidine.  Acute Abdominal Conditions  The administration of meperidine or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.  Special Risk Patients  Meperidine should be given with caution and the initial dose should be reduced in certain patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, and prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture.  Information for Patients  Serotonin Syndrome  Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see  WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ].  Drug Interactions  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or those who have recently received such agents [see  CONTRAINDICTIONS  ]. Therapeutic doses of meperidine have occasionally precipitated unpredictable, severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received such agents within 14 days [see  WARNINGS  ]. The mechanism of these reactions is unclear, but may be related to a preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia. Some have been characterized by coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension, and have resembled the syndrome of acute narcotic overdose. Serotonin syndrome with agitation, hyperthermia, diarrhea, tachycardia, sweating, tremors and impaired consciousness may also occur. In other reactions the predominant manifestations have been hyperexcitability, convulsions, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension.  Do not use Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.  Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisolone have been used to treat severe reactions, with the addition of intravenous chlorpromazine in those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia. The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of these reactions is unknown.  Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6  The concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), or CYP2B6 can increase the plasma concentration of meperidine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is achieved [see WARNINGS ].  After stopping a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the meperidine plasma concentration will decrease [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone.  If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.  If a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.  Inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2B6  The concomitant use of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of meperidine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to meperidine [see WARNINGS ].  After stopping a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the meperidine plasma concentration will increase [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.  If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued, consider Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.  Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants  Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants such as alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.  Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see  WARNINGS  ].  Serotonergic Drugs  The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see  WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients  ].  If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  Infertility  Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , ADVERSE REACTIONS  ].  Pregnancy  Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions  Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see  WARNINGS  ].  Labor or Delivery  Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.  Nursing Mothers  Meperidine appears in the milk of nursing mothers receiving the drug. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.  Infants exposed to Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.  Pediatric Use  Meperidine Hydrochloride administered by the intravenous route via a compatible infusion device is not recommended for use in individuals younger than 19 years of age.  Geriatric Use  Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to meperidine hydrochloride. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.  Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see  WARNINGS  ].</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Important Dosage and Administration Instructions  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS ].  Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  WARNINGS  ].  Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Oxycodone and Aspirin Tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see  WARNINGS  ].  For use as a single-dose unit to provide analgesia via the intravenous route using a compatible Hospira infusion device. Each vial is intended for SINGLE DOSE ONLY. When the dosing requirement is complete, the unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner.  Do not autoclave.  Physicians should completely familiarize themselves with a compatible Hospira infusion device before deciding to administer meperidine hydrochloride injection via the infuser.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit prior to administration.  When administered intravenously, meperidine hydrochloride should be given very slowly . Rapid intravenous injection increases the incidence of adverse reactions; severe respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension, peripheral circulatory collapse and cardiac arrest have occurred. This drug should be administered intravenously only if a narcotic antagonist (i.e., naloxone) and the facilities for assisted or controlled respiration are immediately available. When meperidine hydrochloride is given parenterally, especially intravenously, the patient should be lying down.  Incompatibility  Meperidine hydrochloride is incompatible with soluble barbiturates, aminophylline, heparin, morphine sulfate, methicillin, phenytoin, sodium bicarbonate, iodide, sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole.  Initial Dosage  Adults  The usual initial dose for adult administration via a compatible Hospira infusion device is 10 mg, with a range of 1 to 5 mg per incremental dose. The recommended Lockout Interval is 6 to 10 minutes. The minimum recommended Lockout Interval is 5 minutes.  The physician may adjust the dosage either upward or downward; or, increase or decrease the Lockout Interval, depending on patient response. For continuous infusion the usual adult dose is 15 to 35 mg per hour administered intravenously as required.  Dosage Modifications in Patients  Reduced dosage is indicated in the very young or very old, in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and in patients receiving other central nervous system depressants, including phenathiazines and other tranquilizers. For surgical patients, dosage should be based on response of the patient, other premedication and concomitant medications, the anesthetic being used and the nature and duration of the operation.  Titration and Maintenance of Therapy  Individually titrate Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see  WARNINGS  ]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.  If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.  Discontinuation of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection  When a patient who has been taking meperidine hydrochloride regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient [see  WARNINGS , DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ].</Section>
