2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  •  Pretreatment testing: Renal laboratory testing should be performed in all patients prior to initiation of REYATAZ and continued during treatment with REYATAZ. Hepatic testing should be performed in patients with underlying liver disease prior to initiation of REYATAZ and continued during treatment with REYATAZ. (2.2)  •  Treatment-naive adults: REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food or REYATAZ 400 mg once daily with food. (2.3)  •  Treatment-experienced adults: REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food. (2.3)  •  Pediatric patients: REYATAZ capsule dosage is based on body weight not to exceed the adult dose and must be taken with food. (2.4)  •  REYATAZ oral powder: Must be taken with ritonavir and food and should not be used in pediatric patients who weigh less than 5 kg. (2.5)  •  Pregnancy: REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food, with dosing modifications for some concomitant medications. (2.6)  •  Dosing modifications: may be required for concomitant therapy (  2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6 ), renal impairment (2.7) , and hepatic impairment (2.8) .  2.1 Overview  • REYATAZ capsules and oral powder must be taken with food.  • Do not open the capsules.  • The recommended oral dosage of REYATAZ depends on the treatment history of the patient and the use of other coadministered drugs. When coadministered with H 2 -receptor antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors, dose separation may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 , and 2.6 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .  • REYATAZ capsules without ritonavir are not recommended for treatment-experienced adult or pediatric patients with prior virologic failure [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .  • REYATAZ oral powder must be taken with ritonavir and is not recommended for use in children who weigh less than 5 kg [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ] .  • Efficacy and safety of REYATAZ with ritonavir when ritonavir is administered in doses greater than 100 mg once daily have not been established. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and, therefore, is not recommended. Prescribers should consult the complete prescribing information for ritonavir when using ritonavir.  2.2 Testing Prior to Initiation and During Treatment with REYATAZ  Renal laboratory testing should be performed in all patients prior to initiation of REYATAZ and continued during treatment with REYATAZ. Renal laboratory testing should include serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, and urinalysis with microscopic examination [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 , 5.6 )] .  Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed in patients with underlying liver disease prior to initiation of REYATAZ and continued during treatment with REYATAZ [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] .  2.3 Dosage of REYATAZ in Adult Patients  Table 1 displays the recommended dosage of REYATAZ capsules in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults. Table 1 also displays recommended dosage of REYATAZ and ritonavir when given concomitantly with other antiretroviral drugs and H 2 -receptor antagonists (H2RA). Ritonavir is required with several REYATAZ dosage regimens (see the ritonavir complete prescribing information about the safe and effective use of ritonavir). The use of REYATAZ in treatment-experienced adult patients without ritonavir is not recommended.  Table 1:  Recommended REYATAZ and Ritonavir Dosage in Adults a,b  a   See  Drug Interactions (7)  for instructions concerning coadministration of acid-reducing medications (eg, H2RA or proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]), and other antiretroviral drugs (eg, efavirenz, tenofovir DF, and didanosine).  b   For adult patients who cannot swallow the capsules, REYATAZ oral powder is taken once daily with food at the same recommended adult dosage as the capsules along with ritonavir.

Consult the dosing table for the specific formulation.  Instructions for Mixing REYATAZ Oral Powder [see FDA-approved Instructions for Use]  • Determine the number of packets (3, 4, 5 or 6 packets) that are needed.  • Prior to mixing, tap the packet to settle the powder.  • It is preferable to mix REYATAZ oral powder with food such as applesauce or yogurt. Mixing REYATAZ oral powder with a beverage (milk, infant formula, or water) may be used for infants who can drink from a cup. For young infants (less than 6 months) who cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, REYATAZ oral powder should be mixed with infant formula and given using an oral dosing syringe. Administration of REYATAZ and infant formula using an infant bottle is not recommended because full dose may not be delivered.  • Use a clean pair of scissors to cut each packet along the dotted line.  •  Mixing with food : Using a spoon, mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder packets with a minimum of one tablespoon of food (such as applesauce or yogurt). Feed the mixture to the infant or young child. Add an additional one tablespoon of food to the small container, mix, and feed the child the residual mixture.  •  Mixing with a beverage such as milk or water in a small drinking cup : Using a spoon, mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder packets with a minimum of 30 mL of the beverage. Have the child drink the mixture. Add an additional 15 mL more of beverage to the drinking cup, mix, and have the child drink the residual mixture. If water is used, food should also be taken at the same time.  •  Mixing with liquid infant formula using an oral dosing syringe and a small medicine cup : Using a spoon, mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder packets with 10 mL of prepared liquid infant formula. Draw up the full amount of the mixture into an oral syringe and administer into either right or left inner cheek of infant. Pour another 10 mL of formula into the medicine cup to rinse off remaining REYATAZ oral powder in cup. Draw up residual mixture into the syringe and administer into either right or left inner cheek of infant.  • Administer ritonavir immediately following REYATAZ powder administration.  • Administer the entire dosage of REYATAZ oral powder (mixed in the food or beverage) within one hour of preparation (may leave the mixture at room temperature during this one hour period). Ensure that the patient eats or drinks all the food or beverage that contains the powder. Additional food may be given after consumption of the entire mixture.  2.6 Dosage Adjustments in Pregnant Patients  Table 4 includes the recommended dosage of REYATAZ capsules and ritonavir in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced pregnant patients. In these patients, REYATAZ must be administered with ritonavir. There are no dosage adjustments for postpartum patients (see Table 1 for the recommended REYATAZ dosage in adults) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .  Table 4:  Recommended Dosage of REYATAZ and Ritonavir in Pregnant Patients a  a   See  Drug Interactions (7)  for instructions concerning coadministration of acid-reducing medications (eg, H2RA or PPIs), and other antiretroviral drugs (eg, efavirenz, tenofovir DF, and didanosine).  b   REYATAZ is not recommended for treatment-experienced pregnant patients during the second and third trimester taking REYATAZ with both tenofovir DF and H2RA.  REYATAZ  Once Daily  Dosage  Ritonavir  Once Daily  Dosage  Treatment-Naive and Treatment-Experienced  Recommended Regimen  300 mg  100 mg  Treatment-Experienced During the Second or Third Trimester When Coadministered with either H2RA or Tenofovir DF b  In combination with either H2RA or tenofovir DF  400 mg  100 mg  2.7 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment  For patients with renal impairment, including those with severe renal impairment who are not managed with hemodialysis, no dose adjustment is required for REYATAZ. Treatment-naive patients with end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis should receive REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg. REYATAZ is not recommended in HIV-treatment-experienced patients with end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] .  2.8 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment  Table 5 displays the recommended REYATAZ dosage in treatment-naive patients with hepatic impairment. The use of REYATAZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is not recommended. The coadministration of REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment is not recommended.  Table 5:  Recommended Dosage of REYATAZ Capsules in Treatment-Naive Adults with Hepatic Impairment  REYATAZ Once Daily Dosage  Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A)  400 mg  Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B)  300 mg  Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)  REYATAZ with or without ritonavir is not recommended</Section>
<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  REYATAZ is contraindicated:  • in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions) to any of the components of REYATAZ capsules or REYATAZ oral powder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .  • when coadministered with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A or UGT1A1 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations of the interacting drugs are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (see Table 6).  • when coadministered with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A and may lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of REYATAZ (see Table 6).  Table 6 displays drugs that are contraindicated with REYATAZ.  Table 6:  Drugs that are Contraindicated with REYATAZ (Information in the table applies to REYATAZ with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated)  a   See  Drug Interactions, Table 16 (7)  for parenterally administered midazolam.  b   See  Drug Interactions, Table 16 (7)  for sildenafil when dosed as VIAGRA ® for erectile dysfunction.  Drug Class  Drugs within class that are contraindicated with REYATAZ  Clinical Comment  Alpha 1-Adrenoreceptor Antagonist  Alfuzosin  Potential for increased alfuzosin concentrations, which can result in hypotension.  Antimycobacterials  Rifampin  Rifampin substantially decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.  Antineoplastics  Irinotecan  Atazanavir inhibits UGT1A1 and may interfere with the metabolism of irinotecan, resulting in increased irinotecan toxicities.  Antipsychotics  Lurasidone  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions if REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir.  Pimozide  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Benzodiazepines  Triazolam, orally administered midazolam a  Triazolam and orally administered midazolam are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of triazolam or orally administered midazolam with REYATAZ may cause large increases in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression.  Ergot Derivatives  Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues.  GI Motility Agent  Cisapride  Potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.  Hepatitis C Direct-  Acting Antivirals  Elbasvir/grazoprevir  May increase the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in grazoprevir plasma concentrations.  Herbal Products  St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum )  Coadministration of St. John’s wort and REYATAZ may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.  HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors  Lovastatin, simvastatin  Potential for serious reactions such as myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.  PDE5 Inhibitor  Sildenafil b when dosed as REVATIO ® for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  Potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which include visual disturbances, hypotension, priapism, and syncope).  Protease Inhibitors  Indinavir  Both REYATAZ and indinavir are associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia.  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors  Nevirapine  Nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Potential risk for nevirapine-associated adverse reactions due to increased nevirapine exposures.  • REYATAZ is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions) to any of the components of this product. (4)  • Coadministration with alfuzosin, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone (if REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir), lovastatin, simvastatin, indinavir, cisapride, pimozide, St. John’s wort, nevirapine, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and sildenafil when dosed as REVATIO ® .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  •  Cardiac conduction abnormalities: PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients. ECG monitoring should be considered in patients with preexisting conduction system disease or when administered with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval. (5.1 , 7.3 , 12.2 , 17)  •  Severe Skin Reactions: Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.2 , 17)  •  Hyperbilirubinemia: Most patients experience asymptomatic increases in indirect bilirubin, which is reversible upon discontinuation. Do not dose reduce. If a concomitant transaminase increase occurs, evaluate for alternative etiologies. (5.8)  •  Phenylketonuria: REYATAZ oral powder contains phenylalanine which can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. (5.3)  •  Hepatotoxicity: Patients with hepatitis B or C infection are at risk of increased transaminases or hepatic decompensation. Monitor hepatic laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment. (2.8 , 5.4 , 8.8)  •  Chronic kidney disease has been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir. Consider alternatives in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease. Monitor renal laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment. Consider discontinuation of REYATAZ in patients with progressive renal disease. (5.5)  •  Nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis have been reported. Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation. (5.6)  • The concomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and certain other medications may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (5.7 , 7.3)  • Patients receiving REYATAZ may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia (5.9) , immune reconstitution syndrome (5.10) , and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.11) .  •  Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur and additional factor VIII may be required. (5.12)  5.1 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities  REYATAZ has been shown to prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. In healthy volunteers and in patients, abnormalities in atrioventricular (AV) conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first-degree AV block. There have been reports of second-degree AV block and other conduction abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Overdosage (10) ] . In clinical trials that included electrocardiograms, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5.9% of atazanavir-treated patients (n=920), 5.2% of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients (n=252), 10.4% of nelfinavir-treated patients (n=48), and 3.0% of efavirenz-treated patients (n=329). In Study AI424-045, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5% (6/118) of atazanavir/ritonavir-treated patients and 5% (6/116) of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients who had on-study electrocardiogram measurements. Because of limited clinical experience in patients with preexisting conduction system disease (eg, marked first-degree AV block or second- or third-degree AV block). ECG monitoring should be considered in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .  5.2 Severe Skin Reactions  In controlled clinical trials, rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in approximately 20% of patients treated with REYATAZ. The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7.3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1.4 weeks. Rashes were generally mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash (occurring at a rate of ≥2%) are presented for the individual clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Dosing with REYATAZ was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash. The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was &lt;1%. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic skin eruptions, including drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops.  5.3 Patients with Phenylketonuria  Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). REYATAZ oral powder contains phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each packet of REYATAZ oral powder contains 35 mg of phenylalanine. REYATAZ capsules do not contain phenylalanine.  5.4 Hepatotoxicity  Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C viral infections or marked elevations in transaminases before treatment may be at increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation. In these patients, hepatic laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with REYATAZ and during treatment [see Dosing and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] .  5.5 Chronic Kidney Disease  Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Reports included biopsy-proven cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis associated with the deposition of atazanavir drug crystals in the renal parenchyma. Consider alternatives to REYATAZ in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease. Renal laboratory testing (including serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, and urinalysis with microscopic examination) should be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy with REYATAZ and continued during treatment with REYATAZ. Expert consultation is advised for patients who have confirmed renal laboratory abnormalities while taking REYATAZ. In patients with progressive kidney disease, discontinuation of REYATAZ may be considered [see Dosing and Administration (2.2 and 2.7 ) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis  Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving REYATAZ therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions  Initiation of REYATAZ with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving REYATAZ with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of REYATAZ with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:  • clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.  • clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of REYATAZ with ritonavir.  • loss of therapeutic effect of REYATAZ with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.  See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during REYATAZ/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during REYATAZ/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .  5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia  Most patients taking REYATAZ experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of REYATAZ. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  5.9 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia  New-onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .  5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including REYATAZ. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  5.11 Fat Redistribution  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and “cushingoid appearance” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.  5.12 Hemophilia  There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.  5.13 Resistance/Cross-Resistance  Various degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Resistance to atazanavir may not preclude the subsequent use of other protease inhibitors [see Microbiology (12.4) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  Coadministration of REYATAZ can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of atazanavir. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4 , 7 , 12.3)  7.1 Potential for REYATAZ to Affect Other Drugs  Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and UGT1A1. Coadministration of REYATAZ and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or UGT1A1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects.  Atazanavir is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8. Use of REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended when coadministered with drugs highly dependent on CYP2C8 with narrow therapeutic indices (eg, paclitaxel, repaglinide). When REYATAZ with ritonavir is coadministered with substrates of CYP2C8, clinically significant interactions are not expected [see Clinical Pharmacology, Table 22 (12.3) ] .  The magnitude of CYP3A-mediated drug interactions on coadministered drug may change when REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir. See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir.  7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect REYATAZ  Atazanavir is a CYP3A4 substrate; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and reduce REYATAZ’s therapeutic effect.  Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, buffered medications, or H 2 -receptor antagonists are administered with REYATAZ [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 and 2.6 )] .  7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions  Table 16 provides dosing recommendations in adults as a result of drug interactions with REYATAZ. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy.  Table 16:  Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies a or Predicted Interactions (Information in the table applies to REYATAZ with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated)  Concomitant Drug Class:  Specific Drugs  Effect on Concentration of Atazanavir or Concomitant Drug  Clinical Comment  a   For magnitude of interactions see  Clinical Pharmacology, Tables 21 and 22 (12.3)  .  b   See  Contraindications (4), Table 6  for orally administered midazolam.  c   In combination with atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg once daily.  d   In combination with atazanavir 400 mg once daily.  HIV Antiviral Agents  Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs):  didanosine buffered formulations enteric-coated (EC) capsules  ↓ atazanavir ↓ didanosine  Coadministration of REYATAZ with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure. It is recommended that REYATAZ be given (with food) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations. Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and REYATAZ with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure. Thus, REYATAZ and didanosine EC should be administered at different times.  Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors:  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)  ↓ atazanavir ↑ tenofovir  Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and C min of atazanavir. When coadministered with tenofovir DF in adults, it is recommended that REYATAZ 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). REYATAZ increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving REYATAZ and tenofovir DF should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. For pregnant women taking REYATAZ with ritonavir and tenofovir DF, see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  .  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs):  efavirenz  ↓ atazanavir  Efavirenz decreases atazanavir exposure.  In treatment-naive adult patients:  If REYATAZ is combined with efavirenz, REYATAZ 400 mg (two 200-mg capsules) should be administered with ritonavir 100 mg simultaneously once daily with food, and efavirenz 600 mg should be administered once daily on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime.  In treatment-experienced adult patients:  Coadministration of REYATAZ with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients is not recommended due to decreased atazanavir exposure.  Protease Inhibitors:  saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules)  ↑ saquinavir  Appropriate dosing recommendations for this combination, with or without ritonavir, with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established. In a clinical study, saquinavir 1200 mg coadministered with REYATAZ 400 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg (all given once daily) plus nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not provide adequate efficacy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .  Ritonavir  ↑ atazanavir  If REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir, it is recommended that REYATAZ 300 mg once daily be given with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food in adults. See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir.  Others  ↑ other protease inhibitor  Although not studied, the coadministration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and an additional protease inhibitor would be expected to increase exposure to the other protease inhibitor. Such coadministration is not recommended.  HCV Antiviral Agents  Protease Inhibitors:  boceprevir  ↓ atazanavir ↓ ritonavir  Concomitant administration of boceprevir and atazanavir/ritonavir resulted in reduced steady-state exposures to atazanavir and ritonavir. Coadministration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and boceprevir is not recommended.  Other Agents  Antacids and buffered medications  ↓ atazanavir  Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if antacids, including buffered medications, are administered with REYATAZ. REYATAZ should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications.  Antiarrhythmics:  amiodarone, bepridil, lidocaine (systemic), quinidine  ↑ amiodarone, bepridil, lidocaine (systemic), quinidine  Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events and has not been studied. Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with REYATAZ.  Anticoagulants:  warfarin  ↑ warfarin  Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and/or life-threatening bleeding and has not been studied. It is recommended that International Normalized Ratio (INR) be monitored.  Antidepressants:  tricyclic antidepressants  ↑ tricyclic antidepressants  Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events and has not been studied. Concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with REYATAZ.  Trazodone  ↑ trazodone  Concomitant use of trazodone and REYATAZ with or without ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone. Nausea, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope have been observed following coadministration of trazodone and ritonavir. If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as REYATAZ, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.  Antiepileptics:  carbamazepine  ↓ atazanavir ↑ carbamazepine  Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when carbamazepine is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir. Coadministration of carbamazepine and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended. Ritonavir may increase plasma levels of carbamazepine. If patients beginning treatment with REYATAZ/ritonavir have been titrated to a stable dose of carbamazepine, a dose reduction for carbamazepine may be necessary.  phenytoin, phenobarbital  ↓ atazanavir ↓ phenytoin ↓ phenobarbital  Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when phenytoin or phenobarbital is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir. Coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended. Ritonavir may decrease plasma levels of phenytoin and phenobarbital. When REYATAZ with ritonavir is coadministered with either phenytoin or phenobarbital, a dose adjustment of phenytoin or phenobarbital may be required.  Lamotrigine  ↓ lamotrigine  Coadministration of lamotrigine and REYATAZ  with  ritonavir may decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations. Dose adjustment of lamotrigine may be required when coadministered with REYATAZ and ritonavir. Coadministration of lamotrigine and REYATAZ  without  ritonavir is not expected to decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required when coadministered with REYATAZ without ritonavir.  Antifungals:  ketoconazole, itraconazole  REYATAZ/ritonavir:  ↑ ketoconazole ↑ itraconazole  Coadministration of ketoconazole has only been studied with REYATAZ without ritonavir (negligible increase in atazanavir AUC and C max ). Due to the effect of ritonavir on ketoconazole, high doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole (&gt;200 mg/day) should be used cautiously with REYATAZ/ritonavir.  Voriconazole  REYATAZ/ritonavir in subjects with a functional CYP2C19 allele:  ↓ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir  REYATAZ/ritonavir in subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele:  ↑ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir  The use of voriconazole in patients receiving REYATAZ/ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. Patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole-associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy during the coadministration of voriconazole and REYATAZ/ritonavir. Coadministration of voriconazole with REYATAZ (without ritonavir) may affect atazanavir concentrations; however, no data are available.  Antigout:  colchicine  ↑ colchicine  The coadministration of REYATAZ with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is not recommended.  Recommended adult dosage of colchicine when administered with REYATAZ:  Treatment of gout flares:  0.6 mg (1 tablet) for 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Not to be repeated before 3 days.  Prophylaxis of gout flares:  If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day .  If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day .  Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF):  Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).  Antimycobacterials:  rifabutin  ↑ rifabutin  A rifabutin dose reduction of up to 75% (eg, 150 mg every other day or 3 times per week) is recommended. Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia is warranted.  Antipsychotics:  quetiapine and lurasidone  ↑ quetiapine  Initiation of REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine:  Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.  Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking REYATAZ with ritonavir:  Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine.  REYATAZ  ↑ lurasidone  REYATAZ without ritonavir  If coadministration is necessary, reduce the lurasidone dose. Refer to the lurasidone prescribing information for concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.  REYATAZ/ritonavir  ↑ lurasidone  REYATAZ/ritonavir  Use of lurasidone is contraindicated.  Benzodiazepines:  parenterally administered midazolam b  ↑ midazolam  Concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with REYATAZ may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam. Coadministration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Coadministration of oral midazolam with REYATAZ is CONTRAINDICATED.  Calcium channel blockers:  diltiazem  ↑ diltiazem and desacetyl-diltiazem  Caution is warranted. A dose reduction of diltiazem by 50% should be considered. ECG monitoring is recommended. Coadministration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with diltiazem has not been studied.  felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, and verapamil  ↑ calcium channel blocker  Caution is warranted. Dose titration of the calcium channel blocker should be considered. ECG monitoring is recommended.  Endothelin receptor antagonists:  Bosentan  ↓ atazanavir ↑ bosentan  Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when bosentan is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir. Coadministration of bosentan and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended.  Coadministration of bosentan in adult patients on REYATAZ/ritonavir:  For patients who have been receiving REYATAZ/ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability.  Coadministration of REYATAZ/ritonavir in adult patients on bosentan:  Discontinue bosentan at least 36 hours before starting REYATAZ/ritonavir. At least 10 days after starting REYATAZ/ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors:  atorvastatin, rosuvastatin  ↑ atorvastatin ↑ rosuvastatin  Titrate atorvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose. Rosuvastatin dose should not exceed 10 mg/day. The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors, including REYATAZ, are used in combination with these drugs.  H 2  - Receptor antagonists  ↓ atazanavir  Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when REYATAZ 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.  In treatment-naive adult patients:  REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, a dose of the H 2 -receptor antagonist (H2RA). An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naive patients.                                                                OR  For patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, REYATAZ 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg. The use of REYATAZ without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended.  In treatment-experienced adult patients:  Whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving REYATAZ with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the REYATAZ and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA.  • REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA.  • REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.  • REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester. REYATAZ is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking REYATAZ with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA.  Hormonal contraceptives:  ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate or norethindrone  ↓ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimate c  ↑ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norethindrone d  Use with caution if coadministration of REYATAZ or REYATAZ/ritonavir with oral contraceptives is considered. If an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ plus ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. If REYATAZ is administered without ritonavir, the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol.  Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure. The long-term effects of increases in concentration of the progestational agent are unknown and could increase the risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and acne.  Coadministration of REYATAZ or REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives (eg, contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norethindrone or norgestimate, or less than 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, has not been studied; therefore, alternative methods of contraception are recommended.  Immunosuppressants:  cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus  ↑ immunosuppressants  Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for these immunosuppressants when coadministered with REYATAZ.  Inhaled beta agonist:  Salmeterol  ↑ salmeterol  Coadministration of salmeterol with REYATAZ is not recommended. Concomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia.  Inhaled/nasal steroid:  fluticasone  REYATAZ  ↑ fluticasone  Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ (without ritonavir) may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate. Use with caution. Consider alternatives to fluticasone propionate, particularly for long-term use.  REYATAZ/ritonavir  ↑ fluticasone  Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression, have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  Macrolide antibiotics:  clarithromycin  ↑ clarithromycin ↓ 14-OH clarithromycin ↑ atazanavir  Increased concentrations of clarithromycin may cause QTc prolongations; therefore, a dose reduction of clarithromycin by 50% should be considered when it is coadministered with REYATAZ. In addition, concentrations of the active metabolite 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced; consider alternative therapy for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex. Coadministration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with clarithromycin has not been studied.  Opioids:  Buprenorphine  ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine  Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ with or without ritonavir increases the plasma concentration of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Coadministration of REYATAZ plus ritonavir with buprenorphine warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects. A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered. Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not expected to decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations. Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ without ritonavir may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations. The coadministration of REYATAZ and buprenorphine without ritonavir is not recommended.  PDE5 inhibitors:  sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil  ↑ sildenafil ↑ tadalafil ↑ vardenafil  Coadministration with REYATAZ has not been studied but may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism.  Use of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):    Use of REVATIO ® (sildenafil) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) is contraindicated with REYATAZ [see    Contraindications (4) ] .    The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of ADCIRCA ® (tadalafil) with REYATAZ:    Coadministration of ADCIRCA ® in patients on REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir):  • For patients receiving REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) for at least one week, start ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability.    Coadministration of REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) in patients on ADCIRCA ® :  • Avoid the use of ADCIRCA ® when starting REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir). Stop ADCIRCA ® at least 24 hours before starting REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir). At least one week after starting REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir), resume ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability.  Use of PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction:    Use VIAGRA ® (sildenafil) with caution at reduced doses of 25 mg every 48 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events.    Use CIALIS ® (tadalafil) with caution at reduced doses of 10 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events.  REYATAZ/ritonavir:  Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2.5 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions.  REYATAZ:  Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2.5 mg every 24 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions.  Proton-pump inhibitors:  omeprazole  ↓ atazanavir  Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when REYATAZ 400 mg or REYATAZ 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.  In treatment-naive adult patients:  The proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose.  In treatment-experienced adult patients:  The use of PPIs in treatment-experienced patients receiving REYATAZ is not recommended.  7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions with REYATAZ  No clinically significant drug interactions were observed when REYATAZ was coadministered with methadone, fluconazole, acetaminophen, atenolol, or the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors lamivudine or zidovudine [see Clinical Pharmacology, Tables 21 and 22 (12.3) ] .</Section>
