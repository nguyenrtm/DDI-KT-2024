CONTRAINDICATIONS  • History of cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, stroke, arrhythmias,    congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension)  • During or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors  • Hyperthyroidism  • Glaucoma  • Agitated states  • History of drug abuse  • Pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy)  • Nursing  • Use in combination with other anorectic agents or CNS stimulants  • Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to sympathomimetics.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS SECTION" id="34071-1">
WARNINGS  Phendimetrazine  tartrate should not be used in combination with other anorectic agents, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations and herbal products.  In a case-control epidemiological study, the use of anorectic agents, including phendimetrazine tartrate, was associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, a rare, but often fatal disorder. The use of anorectic agents for longer than three months was associated with a 23-fold increase in the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Increased risk of pulmonary hypertension with repeated courses of therapy cannot be excluded.  The onset or aggravation of exertional dyspnea, or unexplained symptoms of angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema suggest the possibility of occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. Under these circumstances, phendimetrazine tartrate should be immediately discontinued, and the patient should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.  Valvular  heart disease associated with the use of some anorectic agents such as  fenfluramine  and dexfenfluramine has been reported. Possible contributing factors include use for extended periods of time, higher than recommended dose, and/or use in combination with other anorectic drugs.  The potential risk of possible serious adverse effects such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension should be assessed carefully against the potential benefit of weight loss. Baseline cardiac evaluation should be considered to detect preexisting valvular heart diseases or pulmonary hypertension prior to initiation of phendimetrazine treatment. Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended in patients with known heart murmur or valvular heart disease. Echocardiogram during and after treatment could be useful for detecting any valvular disorders which may occur.  Tolerance to the anorectic effect of phendimetrazine develops within a few weeks. When this occurs, its use should be discontinued; the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded. Use of phendimetrazine tartrate within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in a hypertensive crisis. Abrupt cessation of administration following prolonged high dosage results in extreme fatigue and depression. Because of the effect on the central nervous system, phendimetrazine may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.  Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended for patients who used any anorectic agents within the prior year.</Section>
<Section name="PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="42232-9">
PRECAUTIONS  General  Caution is to be exercised in prescribing phendimetrazine tartrate for patients with even mild hypertension.  Insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of phendimetrazine and the concomitant dietary regimen.  Phendimetrazine may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine.  The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  Studies with phendimetrazine tartrate sustained release have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.  Pregnancy  Pregnancy Category X  Phendimetrazine tartrate is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phendimetrazine tartrate, a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine has pharmacological activity similar to amphetamines (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted in phendimetrazine tartrate. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.  Nursing Mothers  It is not known if phendimetrazine tartrate is excreted in human milk. Phendimetrazine tartrate, a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine, has pharmacological activity similar to the amphetamines (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), and other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.  Drug Interactions  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  Use of phendimetrazine tartrate is contraindicated during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of the risk of hypertensive crisis.  Alcohol  Concomitant use of alcohol with phendimetrazine tartrate may result in an adverse drug reaction.  Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemic Medications  Requirements may be altered  Adrenergic Neuron Blocking Drugs  phendimetrazine tartrate may decrease the hypotensive effect of adrenergic neuron blocking drugs.  Pediatric Use  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of phendimetrazine tartrate ER approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended in patients less that 17 years of age.  Renal Impairment  Phendimetrazine tartrate extended-release capsules were not studied in patients with renal impairment. As phendimetrazine tartrate is excreted in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment. Use caution when administering phendimetrazine tartrate to patients with renal impairment.  Geriatric Use  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.  The major route of elimination is via the kidney where most of the drug and metabolites are excreted. The risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Extended-release capsule  Since the product is an extended-release dosage form, limit to one extended-release capsule (105 mg phendimetrazine tartrate) in the morning (30 to 60 minutes before morning meal).
