2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Adults: 5 or 10 mg single dose; separate repeat doses by at least two hours; maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 30 mg ( 2.1 )  Pediatric patients 6 to 17 years: 5 mg single dose in patients less than 40 kg (88 lb); 10 mg single dose in patients 40 kg (88 lb) or more ( 2.2 )  Adjust dose if co-administered with propranolol ( 2.4 )  2.1 Dosing Information in Adults  The recommended starting dose of MAXALT is either 5 mg or 10 mg for the acute treatment of migraines in adults. The 10-mg dose may provide a greater effect than the 5-mg dose, but may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .  Redosing in Adults  Although the effectiveness of a second dose or subsequent doses has not been established in placebo-controlled trials, if the migraine headache returns, a second dose may be administered 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of treating, on average, more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.  2.2 Dosing Information in Pediatric Patients (Age 6 to 17 Years)  Dosing in pediatric patients is based on the patient's body weight. The recommended dose of MAXALT is 5 mg in patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lb), and 10 mg in patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more.  The efficacy and safety of treatment with more than one dose of MAXALT within 24 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age have not been established.  2.3 Administration of MAXALT-MLT Orally Disintegrating Tablets  For MAXALT-MLT Orally Disintegrating Tablets, administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister within an outer aluminum pouch and patients should not remove the blister from the outer pouch until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open with dry hands and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where it will dissolve and be swallowed with the saliva.  2.4 Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Propranolol  Adult Patients  In adult patients taking propranolol, only the 5-mg dose of MAXALT is recommended, up to a maximum of 3 doses in any 24-hour period (15 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].  Pediatric Patients  For pediatric patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more, taking propranolol, only a single 5-mg dose of MAXALT is recommended (maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period). MAXALT should not be prescribed to propranolol-treated pediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg (88 lb) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 )  Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.2 )  Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk ( 5.3 )  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.4 )  Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.5 )  Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 )  Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs ( 5.7 )  5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina  MAXALT should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of MAXALT. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT 1 agonists, including MAXALT may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.  Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving MAXALT. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, MAXALT should not be administered [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first MAXALT dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following MAXALT administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of MAXALT who have cardiovascular risk factors.  5.2 Arrhythmias  Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue MAXALT if these disturbances occur.  5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure  As with other 5-HT 1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with MAXALT and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT 1 agonists.  5.4 Cerebrovascular Events  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue MAXALT if a cerebrovascular event occurs.  As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. MAXALT should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ] .  5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions  5-HT 1 agonists, including MAXALT, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional MAXALT doses.  Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established.  5.6 Medication Overuse Headache  Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.  5.7 Serotonin Syndrome  Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including MAXALT particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) . The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. MAXALT treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] .  5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure  Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT 1 agonists, including MAXALT. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of MAXALT (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. MAXALT is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  7.1 Propranolol  The dose of MAXALT should be adjusted in propranolol-treated patients, as propranolol has been shown to increase the plasma AUC of rizatriptan by 70% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  7.2 Ergot-Containing Drugs  Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and MAXALT within 24 hours is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists  Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of MAXALT and other 5-HT 1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] .  7.4 SSRIs/SNRIs and Serotonin Syndrome  Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] .  7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors  MAXALT is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors. A specific MAO-A inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of rizatriptan and its metabolite [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .</Section>
