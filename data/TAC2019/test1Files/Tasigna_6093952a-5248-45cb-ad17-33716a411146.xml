<Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
2  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  Recommended Dose: Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP: 300 mg orally twice daily . Resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP: 400 mg orally twice daily . ( 2.1 )  Take each Tasigna dose approximately 12 hours apart. Tasigna must be taken on an empty stomach. Avoid food for at least 2 hours before the dose is taken and avoid food for at least 1 hour after the dose is taken. ( 2.1 )  Swallow the capsules whole with water. ( 2.1 )  Eligible newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML-CP who have received Tasigna for a minimum of 3years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) and patients with Ph+ CML-CP resistant or intolerant to imatinib who have received Tasigna for at least 3 years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) may be considered for treatment discontinuation. ( 2.2 , 2.3 )  Dose adjustment may be required for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, and drug interactions . ( 2.4 )  A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment (at baseline). ( 2.4 )  2.1 Recommended Dosing  Tasigna should be taken twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals and must be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before the dose is taken and for at least 1 hour after the dose is taken. Advise patients to swallow the capsules whole with water [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)] .  For patients who are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of each capsule may be dispersed in 1 teaspoon of applesauce (puréed apple). The mixture should be taken immediately (within 15 minutes) and should not be stored for future use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  Tasigna may be given in combination with hematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or G-CSF if clinically indicated. Tasigna may be given with hydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated.  Dosage in  Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP  The recommended dose of Tasigna is 300 mg orally twice daily  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  Dosage in  Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP  The recommended dose of Tasigna (nilotinib) is 400 mg orally twice daily  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  2.2 Discontinuation of treatment after a sustained molecular response (MR 4.5) on Tasigna  Patient Selection  Eligibility for Discontinuation of Treatment  Ph+ CML-CP patients with typical BCR-ABL transcripts who have been taking Tasigna for a minimum of 3 years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5, corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS) may be eligible for treatment discontinuation [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . Information on FDA authorized tests for the detection and quantitation of BCR-ABL transcripts to determine eligibility for treatment discontinuation is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics .  Patients with typical BCR-ABL transcripts (i.e., 13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2) who achieve the sustained MR4.5 criteria are eligible for discontinuation of Tasigna treatment. Patients must continue to be monitored for possible loss of molecular remission after treatment discontinuation. Use the same FDA authorized test to consistently monitor molecular response levels while on and off treatment.   Consider discontinuation of treatment in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP who have:   ● been treated with Tasigna for at least 3 years  ● maintained a molecular response of at least MR4.0 (corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01% IS) for one year prior to discontinuation of therapy   ● achieved an MR4.5 for the last assessment taken immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy   ● been confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts (e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2)  ● no history of accelerated phase or blast crisis  ● no history of prior attempts of treatment-free remission discontinuation that resulted in relapse.  Consider discontinuation of treatment in patients with Ph+ CML-CP that are resistant or intolerant to treatment with imatinib who have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) on Tasigna who have:   ● been treated with Tasigna for a minimum of 3 years  ● been treated with imatinib only prior to treatment with Tasigna  ● achieved a molecular response of MR.4.5 (corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS)  ● sustained an MR4.5 for a minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy   ● been confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts (e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2)  ● no history of accelerated phase or blast crisis  ● no history of prior attempts of treatment-free remission discontinuation that resulted in relapse.  Monitor BCR-ABL transcript levels and complete blood count with differential in patients who have discontinued Tasigna therapy monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)].  Upon the loss of MR4.0 (corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01%IS) during the treatment-free phase, monitor BCR-ABL transcript levels every 2 weeks until BCR-ABL levels remain lower than major molecular response (MMR, corresponding to MR3.0 or = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.1%IS) for 4 consecutive measurements. The patient can then proceed to the original monitoring schedule.  2.3 Re-initiation of treatment in patients who lose molecular response after discontinuation of therapy   with   Tasigna.  ● Newly diagnosed patients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks at the dose level prior to discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions  (  5.1  8)  ] . Patients who re-initiate Tasigna therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored monthly until major molecular response is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter .  ● Patients resistant or intolerant to prior treatment that included imatinib with confirmed loss of MR4.0 (2 consecutive measures separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4.0) or loss of MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks at the dose level prior to discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. Patients who re-initiate Tasigna therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored monthly until previous major molecular response or MR 4.0 is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter.  2.4 Dose Adjustments or Modifications  QT  I  nterval  P  rolongation:  Table 1: Dose Adjustments for QT Prolongation  ECGs with a QTc greater than 480 msec  1. Withhold Tasigna, and perform an analysis of serum potassium and magnesium, and if below lower limit of normal, correct with supplements to within normal limits. Concomitant medication usage must be reviewed. 2. Resume within 2 weeks at prior dose if QTcF returns to less than 450 msec and to within 20 msec of baseline. 3. If QTcF is between 450 msec and 480 msec after 2 weeks, reduce the dose to 400 mg once daily. 4. Discontinue Tasigna if, following dose-reduction to 400 mg once daily, QTcF returns to greater than 480 msec. 5. An ECG should be repeated approximately 7 days after any dose adjustment.  Myelosuppression    Withhold or dose-reduce Tasigna for hematological toxicities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) that are not related to underlying leukemia (Table 2).  Table 2: Dose Adjustments for Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia  Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase at 300 mg twice daily  Resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase at 400 mg twice daily  ANC* less than 1.0 x 10 9 /L and/or platelet counts less than 50 x 10 9 /L  1. Stop Tasigna, and monitor blood counts 2. Resume within 2 weeks at prior dose if ANC greater than 1.0 x 10 9 /L and platelets greater than 50 x 10 9 /L 3. If blood counts remain low for greater than 2 weeks, reduce the dose to 400 mg once daily  *ANC=absolute neutrophil count  See Table 3 for dose adjustments for elevations of lipase, amylase, bilirubin, and/or hepatic transaminases [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Table 3: Dose Adjustments for Selected Non-Hematologic Laboratory Abnormalities  Elevated serum lipase or amylase greater than or equal to Grade 3  1. Withhold Tasigna, and monitor serum lipase or amylase 2. Resume treatment at 400 mg once daily if serum lipase or amylase returns to less than or equal to Grade 1  Elevated bilirubin greater than or equal to Grade 3  1. Withhold Tasigna, and monitor bilirubin 2. Resume treatment at 400 mg once daily if bilirubin returns to less than or equal to Grade 1  Elevated hepatic transaminases greater than or equal to Grade 3  1. Withhold Tasigna, and monitor hepatic transaminases 2. Resume treatment at 400 mg once daily if hepatic transaminases returns to less than or equal to Grade 1  Other Non-  H  ematologic Toxicities  If other clinically significant moderate or severe non-hematologic toxicity develops, withhold dosing, and resume at 400 mg once daily when the toxicity has resolved. If clinically appropriate, escalation of the dose back to 300 mg (newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP) or 400 mg (resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP) twice daily should be considered. For Grade 3 to 4 lipase elevations, dosing should be withheld, and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily. Test serum lipase levels monthly or as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 to 4 bilirubin or hepatic transaminase elevations, dosing should be withheld, and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily. Test bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels monthly or as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  5  , 5.  6  ), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].  Hepatic Impairment    If possible, consider alternative therapies. If Tasigna must be administered to patients with hepatic impairment, consider the following dose reduction:  Table 4: Dose Adjustments for Hepatic Impairment (At Baseline)  Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase at 300 mg twice daily  Mild, Moderate, or Severe*  An initial dosing regimen of 200 mg twice daily followed by dose escalation to 300 mg twice daily based on tolerability  Resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase at 400 mg twice daily  Mild or Moderate*  An initial dosing regimen of 300 mg twice daily followed by dose escalation to 400 mg twice daily based on tolerability  Severe*  A starting dose of 200 mg twice daily followed by a sequential dose escalation to 300 mg twice daily and then to 400 mg twice daily based on tolerability  *Mild=mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A); Moderate=moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B); Severe=severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  10  ), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] .  Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors    Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole). Avoid grapefruit products since they may also increase serum concentrations of nilotinib. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, therapy with Tasigna should be interrupted. If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, based on pharmacokinetic studies, consider a dose reduction to 300 mg once daily in patients with resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML or to 200 mg once daily in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, a washout period should be allowed before the Tasigna dose is adjusted upward to the indicated dose. For patients who cannot avoid use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor closely for prolongation of the QT interval [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.  8  ), Drug Interactions (7.2)] .  Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers    Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital). Also inform patients not to take St. John’s Wort since these agents may reduce the concentration of Tasigna. Based on the nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile of nilotinib, increasing the dose of Tasigna when coadministered with such agents is unlikely to compensate for the loss of exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Myelosuppression: Associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia . Obtain CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly . Manage by treatment interruption or dose-reduction. ( 5.1 )  Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Occlusive Events: Cardiovascular events including ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease and ischemic cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML receiving Tasigna. Evaluate cardiovascular status, monitor and manage cardiovascular risk factors during Tasigna therapy. ( 5.4 )  Pancreatitis and elevated serum lipase: Monitor serum lipase monthly or as clinically indicated. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt doses and consider appropriate diagnostics to exclude pancreatitis. ( 5.5 )  Hepatotoxicity: Tasigna may result in elevations in bilirubin, AST/ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Monitor hepatic function tests monthly or as clinically indicated. ( 5.6 )  Electrolyte abnormalities: Tasigna can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating Tasigna and monitor periodically during therapy. ( 5.7 , 5.15 )  Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome cases have been reported in Tasigna treated patients with resistant or intolerant CML . Maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Tasigna. ( 5.11 )  Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage from any site may occur. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically manage as needed. ( 5.12 )  Total gastrectomy: May reduce exposure. Consider dose-increase and monitor for effectiveness more frequently. ( 5.13 )  Fluid retention: Pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and severe fluid retention have occurred in patients receiving Tasigna. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms such as unexpected rapid weight gain, swelling, and shortness of breath. ( 5.16 )   Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Tasigna can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 )  Treatment Discontinuation: Patients must have typical BCR-ABL transcripts. An FDA-authorized test with a detection limit below MR4.5 must be used to determine eligibility for discontinuation. Patients must be frequently monitored by the FDA authorized test to detect possible loss of remission. ( 5.18 )  5.1 Myelosuppression  Treatment with Tasigna can cause Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia . Perform complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding Tasigna temporarily or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.  4  )].  5.2 QT Prolongation  Tasigna has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization as measured by the QT interval on the surface ECG in a concentration-dependent manner [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology  (12.6)]. Prolongation of the QT interval can result in a type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes, which may result in syncope, seizure, and/or death. ECGs should be performed at baseline, 7 days after initiation of Tasigna, and periodically as clinically indicated and following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  1  5  )].  Tasigna should not be used in patients who have hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or long QT syndrome. Before initiating Tasigna and periodically, test electrolyte, calcium and magnesium blood levels. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating Tasigna and these electrolytes should be monitored periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].  Significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when Tasigna is inappropriately taken with food and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT. Therefore, coadministration with food must be avoided and concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  8  , 5.  9  )] . The presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may further prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  7  , 5.  1  5  )] .  5.3 Sudden Deaths  Sudden deaths have been reported in 0.3% of patients with CML treated with nilotinib in clinical studies of 5,661 patients. The relative early occurrence of some of these deaths relative to the initiation of nilotinib suggests the possibility that ventricular repolarization abnormalities may have contributed to their occurrence.  5.4 Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Occlusive Events  Cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, were reported in a randomized, clinical trial in newly diagnosed CML patients and observed in the postmarketing reports of patients receiving nilotinib therapy. With a median time on therapy of 60 months in the clinical trial, cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, occurred in 9.3% and 15.2% of patients in the Tasigna 300 and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and in 3.2% in the imatinib arm. These included cases of cardiovascular events including ischemic heart disease-related cardiac events (5.0% and 9.4% in the Tasigna 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms respectively, and 2.5% in the imatinib arm), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (3.6% and 2.9% in the Tasigna 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms respectively, and 0% in the imatinib arm), and ischemic cerebrovascular events (1.4% and 3.2% in the Tasigna 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms respectively, and 0.7% in the imatinib arm). If acute signs or symptoms of cardiovascular events occur, advise patients to seek immediate medical attention. The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored and actively managed during Tasigna therapy according to standard guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.  4  )] .  5.5 Pancreatitis and Elevated Serum Lipase  Tasigna can cause increases in serum lipase. Patients with a previous history of pancreatitis may be at greater risk of elevated serum lipase. If lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt dosing and consider appropriate diagnostics to exclude pancreatitis. Test serum lipase levels monthly or as clinically indicated.  5.6 Hepatotoxicity  Tasigna may result in hepatotoxicity as measured by elevations in bilirubin, AST/ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Monitor hepatic function tests monthly or as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions  (  5.  1  5  )  ] .  5.7 Electrolyte Abnormalities  The use of Tasigna can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating Tasigna and during therapy. Monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.  1  5  )].  5.8 Drug Interactions   Avoid administration of Tasigna with agents that may increase nilotinib exposure (e.g., strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) or anti-arrhythmic drugs (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other drugs that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin and pimozide). Should treatment with any of these agents be required, interrupt therapy with Tasigna. If interruption of treatment with Tasigna is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT or strongly inhibits CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.  4  ), Drug Interactions (7.2)].  5.9 Food Effects  The bioavailability of nilotinib is increased with food, thus Tasigna must not be taken with food. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before and for at least 1 hour after the dose is taken. Also avoid grapefruit products and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 [see Boxed Warning, Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  5.10 Hepatic Impairment  Nilotinib exposure is increased in patients with impaired hepatic function. Use a lower starting dose for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (at baseline) and monitor the QT interval frequently [see Dosage and Administration (2.  4  ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] .  5.11 Tumor Lysis Syndrome  Tumor lysis syndrome cases have been reported in Tasigna treated patients with resistant or intolerant CML. Malignant disease progression, high WBC counts and/or dehydration were present in the majority of these cases. Due to potential for tumor lysis syndrome, maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Tasigna.  5.12 Hemorrhage  Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in patients with CML treated with Tasigna. In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing Tasigna and imatinib, Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% of patients in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily arm, in 1.8% patients in the Tasigna 400 mg twice daily arm, and 0.4% of patients in the imatinib arm. GI hemorrhage occurred in 2.9% and 5.1% of patients in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily arms and in 1.4% of patients in the imatinib arm, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 0.7% and 1.4% of patients in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and in no patients in the imatinib arm.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically manage as needed.  5.13 Total Gastrectomy  Since the exposure of nilotinib is reduced in patients with total gastrectomy, perform more frequent monitoring of these patients. Consider dose increase or alternative therapy in patients with total gastrectomy [see Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.3)] .  5.14 Lactose  Since the capsules contain lactose, Tasigna is not recommended for patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, severe lactase deficiency with a severe degree of intolerance to lactose-containing products, or of glucose-galactose malabsorption.  5.15 Monitoring Laboratory Tests  Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically . ECGs should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of Tasigna therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway  [  see Drug Interactions (7.1)  ] . Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physician should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.  5.16  Fluid Retention  In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions were severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in no patients receiving imatinib. Similar events were also observed in postmarketing reports. Monitor patients for signs of severe fluid retention (e.g., unexpected rapid weight gain or swelling) and for symptoms of respiratory or cardiac compromise (e.g., shortness of breath) during Tasigna treatment; evaluate etiology and treat patients accordingly.  5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Tasigna can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nilotinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality/fetal effects (small renal papilla, fetal edema, and skeletal variations) in rats and increased resorptions of fetuses and fetal skeletal variations in rabbits at maternal AUCs approximately 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 14 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].  5.18 Monitoring of BCR-ABL Transcript Levels   Monitoring of BCR-ABL Transcript Levels in Patients Who Discontinued Tasigna  Monitor BCR-ABL transcript levels in patients eligible for treatment discontinuation using an FDA authorized test validated to measure molecular response levels with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS). In patients who discontinue Tasigna therapy, assess BCR-ABL transcript levels monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter during treatment discontinuation [see Clinical  S  tudies (14.3  ,  14.4)  and Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .   Newly diagnosed patients must reinitiate Tasigna therapy within 4 weeks of a loss of Major Molecular Response (MMR, corresponding to MR3.0 or = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.1%IS).  Patients resistant or intolerant to prior treatment which included imatinib must reinitiate Tasigna therapy within 4 weeks of a loss of MMR or confirmed loss of MR4.0 (two consecutive measures separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4.0, corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01%IS).  For patients who fail to achieve MMR after three months of treatment re initiation, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation testing should be performed.  Monitoring of  BCR-ABL Transcript Levels in  Patients who have Reinitiated Therapy after Los  s  of Molecular Response  Monitor CBC and BCR-ABL transcripts in patients who re-initiate treatment with Tasigna due to loss of molecular response quantitation every 4 weeks until a major molecular response is re-established, then every 12 weeks.</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7  DRUG INTERACTIONS  Tasigna is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. It may also induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Therefore, Tasigna may alter serum concentration of other drugs ( 7.1 )  7.1 Effects of Nilotinib on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems  Nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and UGT1A1 in vitro, potentially increasing the concentrations of drugs eliminated by these enzymes. In vitro studies also suggest that nilotinib may induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, and decrease the concentrations of drugs which are eliminated by these enzymes.  In patients with CML, multiple doses of Tasigna increased the systemic exposure of oral midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6-fold. Tasigna is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) may be increased when coadministered with Tasigna. Dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, especially those that have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus) when coadministered with Tasigna.  Single-dose administration of Tasigna to healthy subjects did not change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). The ability of multiple doses of Tasigna to induce metabolism of drugs other than midazolam has not been determined in vivo . Monitor patients closely when coadministering Tasigna with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index and are substrates for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP2C9 enzymes.  Nilotinib inhibits human P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If Tasigna is administered with drugs that are substrates of P-gp, increased concentrations of the substrate drug are likely, and caution should be exercised.  7.2 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce Cytochrome P450 3A4 Enzymes  Nilotinib undergoes metabolism by CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 can increase or decrease nilotinib concentrations significantly. Avoid the administration of Tasigna with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.  8  )] . Concomitant use of Tasigna with medicinal products and herbal preparations that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 is likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, in patients receiving Tasigna, select alternative therapeutic agents with less potential for CYP3A4 induction for concomitant use.   Ketoconazole : In healthy subjects receiving ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 400 mg once daily for 6 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to nilotinib was increased approximately 3-fold .  Rifampicin : In healthy subjects receiving the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, at 600 mg daily for 12 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to nilotinib was decreased approximately 80%.  7.3 Drugs that Affect Gastric pH  The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with Tasigna is not recommended. Nilotinib has pH-dependent solubility, with decreased solubility at higher pH. Drugs such as proton pump inhibitors that inhibit gastric acid secretion to elevate the gastric pH may decrease the solubility of nilotinib and reduce its bioavailability. In healthy subjects, coadministration of a single 400 mg dose of Tasigna with multiple doses of esomeprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor) at 40 mg daily decreased the nilotinib AUC by 34%. Increasing the dose of Tasigna when coadministered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Since proton pump inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction.  In healthy subjects, no significant change in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was observed when a single 400 mg dose of Tasigna was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine (an H2 blocker). Therefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered approximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna.  Administration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone) to healthy subjects, 2 hours before or 2 hours after a single 400 mg dose of Tasigna did not alter nilotinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, if necessary, an antacid may be administered approximately 2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna.  7.4 Drugs that Inhibit Drug Transport Systems  Nilotinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1). If Tasigna is administered with drugs that inhibit P-gp, increased concentrations of nilotinib are likely, and caution should be exercised.  7.5 Drugs that May Prolong the QT Interval  The administration of Tasigna with agents that may prolong the QT interval such as anti-arrhythmic medicines should be avoided [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.  8  )] .</Section>
