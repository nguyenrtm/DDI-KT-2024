<Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">
4  CONTRAINDICATIONS  • ACIPHEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to rabeprazole, substituted benzimidazoles, or to any component of the formulation.  Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ] .  • PPIs, including ACIPHEX, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ] .  • For information about contraindications of antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated in combination with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, refer to the Contraindications section of their package inserts.  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rabeprazole ( 4 ).   PPIs, including ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products ( 4 ,  7 ).  Refer to the Contraindications section of the prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin, when administered in combination with ACIPHEX ( 4 ).</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Gastric Malignancy :  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with rabeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing ( 5.1 ).  Use with  Warfarin :  Monitor for increases in INR and prothrombin time ( 5.2 , 7 ).  Acute  Interstitial Nephritis : Observed in patients taking PPIs ( 5.3 ).  Clostridium  difficile  -  Associated Diarrhea :  PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of ( 5.4 ).  Bone  Fracture :  Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine ( 5.5 ).  Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous, new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue ACIPHEX and refer to specialist for evaluation ( 5.6 ).  Cyanocobalamin (  V  itamin B-12) Deficiency :  Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin ( 5.7 ).  Hypomagnesemia :  Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.8 ).  Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets ( 5.9 , 7).  5.1  Presence of  G  astric  M  alignancy  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with ACIPHEX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI.  5.2  Interaction  with  W  arfarin  Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients.  There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly.  Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.  Patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time  [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ] .  5.3  Acute Interstitial Nephritis  Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including ACIPHEX.  Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction.  Discontinue ACIPHEX if acute interstitial nephritis develops [  see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .  5.  4  Clostridium  difficile  -  A  ssociated  D  iarrhea  Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ACIPHEX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium  difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.  This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [  see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ] .  Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.  Clostridium  difficile  - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents.  For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with ACIPHEX, refer to   Warnings and Precautions   sections of the corresponding prescribing information.  5.  5  Bone Fracture  Several published observational studies in adults suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine.  The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).  Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.  Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [  see    Dosage and Administration (2)  ,    Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ] .  5.6  Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including rabeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.  The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.  Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ACIPHEX, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks.  Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.  5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency  Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with ACIPHEX.  5.8 Hypomagnesemia  Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.  For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ] .  5.  9  Interaction  with Methotrexate  Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information ) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.  In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [  see  Drug Interactions (7)  ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7  DRUG INTERACTIONS  Table 2 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them.  Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs.  Table 2: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets and Interactions with Diagnostics  Antiretrovirals  Clinical Impact:  The effect of PPI on antiretroviral drugs is variable.  The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.  Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.  Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may increase toxicity .  There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with rabeprazole.  Intervention:  Rilpivirine  -containing products :  Concomitant use with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is contraindicated  [see  Contraindications (4)  ] . See prescribing information.        Atazanavir :  See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information.       Nelfinavir : Avoid concomitant use with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. See prescribing information for nelfinavir.       Saquinavir:   See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities.        Other antiretrovirals :  See prescribing information.  Warfarin  Clinical Impact:  Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including rabeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly.  Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ] .  Intervention:  Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range.  See prescribing information for warfarin.  Methotrexate  Clinical Impact:  Concomitant use of rabeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.  No formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ].  Intervention:  A temporary withdrawal of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets may be considered in some patients receiving high dose methotrexate administration.  Digoxin  Clinical Impact:  Potential for increased exposure of digoxin [  see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  Intervention:  Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin.  Drugs  Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., ir  on salts, erlotinib,  dasatinib, nilotinib,  mycophenol  ate mofetil, ketoconazole  , itraconazole  )  Clinical Impact:  Rabeprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.   Intervention:  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.  The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets  and MMF.  Use ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.  Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin  and Amoxicillin  Clinical Impact:  Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions.  Intervention:  See   Contraindications  and  Warnings and Precautions   in prescribing information for clarithromycin. See  Drug Interactions   in prescribing information for amoxicillin.  Tacrolimus  Clinical Impact:  Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 .  Intervention:  Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus.  Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors  Clinical Impact  :  Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors .  Intervention:  Temporarily stop ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.  Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test  Clinical Impact:  Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.  Intervention:  Temporarily stop treatment with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline.  False Positive Urine Tests for THC  Clinical Impact:  There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.  Intervention:  An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.  See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions ( 7 ).</Section>
