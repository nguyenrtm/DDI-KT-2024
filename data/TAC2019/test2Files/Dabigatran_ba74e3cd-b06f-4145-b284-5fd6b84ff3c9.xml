P-gp inhibition and impaired renal functionare the major independent factors that result in increased exposureto dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use of P-gpinhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produceincreased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with eitherfactor alone.  In patientswith moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), reduce the doseof PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly withthe P-gp inhibitors dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The useof the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin,and ticagrelor does not require a dose adjustment of PRADAXA.

The concomitantuse of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment(CrCl 15-30 mL/min) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions( 5.5 ), Use in Specific Populations( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .  7.2 Treatment and Reductionin the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and PulmonaryEmbolism  Avoiduse of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .  7.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism FollowingHip Replacement Surgery  In patients with CrCl ≥50 mL/min who haveconcomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors such as dronedaroneor systemic ketoconazole, it may be helpful to separate the timingof administration of dabigatran and the P-gp inhibitor by severalhours. The concomitant use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patientswith CrCl &lt;50 mL/min should be avoided [see Warnings andPrecautions ( 5.5 ), Use in SpecificPopulations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology( 12.2 , 12.3 )] .</Section>

12  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombininhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversionof fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibitionprevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-boundthrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibitedby the active moieties.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs thecoagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, and TT. INR is relativelyinsensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpretedthe same way as used for warfarin monitoring.  The aPTT test provides an approximation of PRADAXA’santicoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT,following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degreesof renal impairment is shown in Figure 2. The curves represent meanlevels without confidence intervals; variations should be expectedwhen measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the levelof recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, thecurves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular levelof recovery, even when the time since the last dose of PRADAXA isnot precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10 th to 90 th percentile) troughaPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.  Figure 2 Average Time Course forEffects of Dabigatran on aPTT, Following Approved PRADAXA Dosing Regimensin Patients with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment*  *Simulations based onPK data from a study in subjects with renal impairment and PK/aPTTrelationships derived from the RE-LY study; aPTT prolongation in RE-LYwas measured centrally in citrate plasma using PTT Reagent Roche DiagnosticsGmbH, Mannheim, Germany. There may be quantitative differences betweenvarious established methods for aPTT assessment.  The degree of anticoagulant activity can also be assessedby the ecarin clotting time (ECT). This test is a more specific measureof the effect of dabigatran than activated partial thromboplastintime (aPTT). In the RE-LY trial, the median (10 th to 90 th percentile) trough ECT in patientsreceiving the 150 mg dose was 63 (44 to 103) seconds.  In orthopedic hip surgery patients,maximum aPTT response (Emax) to dabigatran and baseline aPTT werehigher shortly after surgery than at later time points (e.g. ≥3 daysafter surgery).  Cardiac Electrophysiology  No prolongation of the QTc interval was observed withdabigatran etexilate at doses up to 600 mg.  Figure 2  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is absorbed as the dabigatran etexilateester. The ester is then hydrolyzed, forming dabigatran, the activemoiety. Dabigatran is metabolized to four different acyl glucuronidesand both the glucuronides and dabigatran have similar pharmacologicalactivity. Pharmacokinetics described here refer to the sum of dabigatranand its glucuronides. Dabigatran displays dose-proportional pharmacokineticsin healthy subjects and patients in the range of doses from 10 to400 mg.  Absorption  The absolutebioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatranetexilate is approximately 3 to 7%. Dabigatran etexilate is a substrateof the efflux transporter P-gp. After oral administration of dabigatranetexilate in healthy volunteers, C max occursat 1 hour post-administration in the fasted state. Coadministrationof PRADAXA with a high-fat meal delays the time to C max by approximately 2 hours but has no effect on the bioavailabilityof dabigatran; PRADAXA may be administered with or without food.  The oral bioavailability of dabigatran etexilateincreases by 75% when the pellets are taken without the capsule shellcompared to the intact capsule formulation. PRADAXA capsules shouldtherefore not be broken, chewed, or opened before administration.  Distribution  Dabigatranis approximately 35% bound to human plasma proteins. The red bloodcell to plasma partitioning of dabigatran measured as total radioactivityis less than 0.3. The volume of distribution of dabigatran is 50 to70 L. Dabigatran pharmacokinetics are dose proportional after singledoses of 10 to 400 mg. Given twice daily, dabigatran’s accumulationfactor is approximately two.  Elimination  Dabigatranis eliminated primarily in the urine. Renal clearance of dabigatranis 80% of total clearance after intravenous administration. Afteroral administration of radiolabeled dabigatran, 7% of radioactivityis recovered in urine and 86% in feces. The half-life of dabigatranin healthy subjects is 12 to 17 hours.  Metabolism  After oraladministration, dabigatran etexilate is converted to dabigatran. The cleavage of the dabigatran etexilate by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysisto the active principal dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. Dabigatran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically activeacyl glucuronides. Four positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, and 4-O-acylglucuronideexist, and each accounts for less than 10% of total dabigatran inplasma.  Renal Impairment  An open,parallel-group single-center study compared dabigatran pharmacokineticsin healthy subjects and patients with mild to moderate renal impairmentreceiving a single dose of PRADAXA 150 mg. Exposure to dabigatranincreases with severity of renal function impairment (Table 8). Similarfindings were observed in the RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II trials.  Table 8 Impact of Renal Impairment on Dabigatran Pharmacokinetics  + Patientswith severe renal impairment were not studied in RE-LY, RE-COVER andRE-NOVATE II. Dosing recommendations in subjects with severe renalimpairment are based on pharmacokinetic modeling [see Dosageand Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .  Renal Function  CrCl (mL/min)  Increase inAUC  Increase inC max  t 1/2  (h)  Normal  ≥ 80  1x  1x  13  Mild  50-80  1.5x  1.1x  15  Moderate  30-50  3.2x  1.7x  18  Severe +  15-30  6.3x  2.1x  27  Hepatic Impairment  Administrationof PRADAXA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-PughB) showed a large inter-subject variability, but no evidence of aconsistent change in exposure or pharmacodynamics.  Drug Interactions  A summary of the effect of coadministered drugs on dabigatran exposureis shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2.  In the orthopedic hip surgery patients,limited clinical data with P-gp inhibitors is available.  Figure 3.1 Effect of P-gpInhibitor or Inducer (rifampicin) Drugs on Peak and Total Exposureto Dabigatran (Cmax and AUC). Shown are the Geometric Mean Ratios(Ratio) and 90% Confidence Interval (90% CI).

The Perpetrator and Dabigatran EtexilateDose and Dosing Frequency are given as well as the Time of PerpetratorDosing in Relation to Dabigatran Etexilate Dose (Time Difference)  Figure 3.1  Figure 3.2  In RE-LY, dabigatran plasma samples were also collected. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists, anddigoxin did not appreciably change the trough concentration of dabigatran.  Impact of Dabigatran onOther Drugs  In clinical studies exploring CYP3A4,CYP2C9, P-gp and other pathways, dabigatran did not meaningfully alterthe pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, atorvastatin, clarithromycin,diclofenac, clopidogrel, digoxin, pantoprazole, or ranitidine.</Section>
