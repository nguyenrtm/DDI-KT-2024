7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI)  Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desvenlafaxine or within 7 days of stopping treatment with desvenlafaxine. Do not use desvenlafaxine within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start desvenlafaxine in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 ) , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  7.2 Serotonergic Drugs  Based on the mechanism of action of desvenlafaxine and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when desvenlafaxine is co-administered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  7.3 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)  Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when PRISTIQ is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] .  7.4 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Desvenlafaxine  Based on in vitro data, no dose adjustment is required for PRISTIQ when used concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2D6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and the P-glycoprotein transporter. Clinical studies have demonstrated no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between PRISTIQ and strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (Figure 1).  Figure 1  7.5 Potential for Desvenlafaxine to Affect Other Drugs  Clinical studies have shown that desvenlafaxine does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP2D6 metabolism at the dose of 100 mg daily (Figure 2). Substrates primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., desipramine , atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine) should be dosed at the original level when co-administered with PRISTIQ 100 mg or lower or when PRISTIQ is discontinued. Reduce the dose of these substrates by up to one-half if co-administered with 400 mg of PRISTIQ.  No additional dose adjustment is required for concomitant use of substrates of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 isozymes, and P-glycoprotein transporter. Clinical studies have demonstrated no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between PRISTIQ and CYP3A4 substrates (Figure 2).  Clinical studies have shown that desvenlafaxine (100 mg daily) does not have a clinically relevant effect on tamoxifen and aripiprazole, compounds that are metabolized by a combination of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes (Figure 2).  In vitro studies showed minimal inhibitory effect of desvenlafaxine on the CYP2D6 isoenzyme.  In vitro , desvenlafaxine does not inhibit or induce the CYP3A4 isozyme.  In vitro , desvenlafaxine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19, isozymes, and P-glycoprotein transporter and would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these CYP isozymes and transporter.  Figure 2  7.6 Other Drugs Containing Desvenlafaxine or Venlafaxine  Avoid use of PRISTIQ with other desvenlafaxine-containing products or venlafaxine products. The concomitant use of PRISTIQ with other desvenlafaxine-containing products or venlafaxine will increase desvenlafaxine blood levels and increase dose-related adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6) ].  7.7 Ethanol  A clinical study has shown that PRISTIQ does not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by ethanol. However, as with all CNS-active drugs, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol consumption while taking PRISTIQ.  7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions  False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking desvenlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of desvenlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish desvenlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of desvenlafaxine is unknown, but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, through inhibition of their reuptake. Non-clinical studies have shown that desvenlafaxine is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  Desvenlafaxine lacked significant affinity for numerous receptors, including muscarinic-cholinergic, H 1 -histaminergic, or Î± 1 -adrenergic receptors in vitro . Desvenlafaxine also lacked monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity.  ECG changes  Electrocardiograms were obtained from 1,492 desvenlafaxine treated patients with major depressive disorder and 984 placebo-treated patients in clinical studies lasting up to 8 weeks. No clinically relevant differences were observed between desvenlafaxine treated and placebo-treated patients for QT, QTc, PR, and QRS intervals. In a thorough QTc study with prospectively determined criteria, desvenlafaxine did not cause QT prolongation. No difference was observed between placebo and desvenlafaxine treatments for the QRS interval.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  The single-dose pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 50 to 600 mg per day. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately 4 to 5 days. At steady-state, multiple-dose accumulation of desvenlafaxine is linear and predictable from the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile.  Absorption and distribution  The absolute oral bioavailability of PRISTIQ after oral administration is about 80%.  A food-effect study involving administration of PRISTIQ to healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions (high-fat meal, 800 to 1000 calories) indicated that desvenlafaxine C max was increased about 16% in the fed state, while the AUCs were similar. This difference is not expected to be clinically significant; therefore, PRISTIQ can be taken without regard to meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] .  The plasma protein binding of desvenlafaxine is low (30%) and is independent of drug concentration. The desvenlafaxine volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration is 3.4 L/kg, indicating distribution into nonvascular compartments.  Metabolism and elimination  Desvenlafaxine is primarily metabolized by conjugation (mediated by UGT isoforms) and, to a minor extent, through oxidative metabolism. CYP3A4 is the cytochrome P450 isozyme mediating the oxidative metabolism (N-demethylation) of desvenlafaxine. The CYP2D6 metabolic pathway is not involved, and after administration of 100 mg, the pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine was similar in subjects with CYP2D6 poor and extensive metabolizer phenotype. Approximately 45% of desvenlafaxine is excreted unchanged in urine at 72 hours after oral administration. Approximately 19% of the administered dose is excreted as the glucuronide metabolite and &lt;5% as the oxidative metabolite (N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine) in urine.  Drug interaction studies  Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole)  CYP3A4 is a minor pathway for the metabolism of desvenlafaxine. In a clinical study, ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of desvenlafaxine (400 mg single dose) by about 43% and C max by about 8%. Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher concentrations of desvenlafaxine.  Inhibitors of other CYP enzymes  Based on in vitro data, drugs that inhibit CYP isozymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2D6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1 are not expected to have significant impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of desvenlafaxine.  Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g. desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, atomoxetine)  In vitro studies showed minimal inhibitory effect of desvenlafaxine on CYP2D6. Clinical studies have shown that desvenlafaxine does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP2D6 metabolism at the dose of 100 mg daily. When desvenlafaxine succinate was administered at a dose of 100 mg daily in conjunction with a single 50 mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the C max and AUC of desipramine increased approximately 25% and 17%, respectively. When 400 mg (8 times the recommended 50 mg dose) was administered, the C max and AUC of desipramine increased approximately 50% and 90%, respectively. Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine with a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 can result in higher concentrations of that drug [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ].  Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (midazolam)  In vitro, desvenlafaxine does not inhibit or induce the CYP3A4 isozyme. In a clinical study, desvenlafaxine 400 mg daily (8 times the recommended 50 mg dose) was co-administered with a single 4 mg dose of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate). The AUC and C max of midazolam decreased by approximately 31% and 16%, respectively. Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine with a drug metabolized by CYP3A4 can result in lower exposures to that drug.  Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19  In vitro, desvenlafaxine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 isozymes and would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by these CYP isozymes.  In vitro, desvenlafaxine is not a substrate or an inhibitor for the P-glycoprotein transporter. The pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine are unlikely to be affected by drugs that inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter, and desvenlafaxine is not likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter.  Special populations  Age  In a study of healthy subjects administered doses of up to 300 mg, there was an approximate 32% increase in C max and a 55% increase in AUC in subjects older than 75 years of age (n = 17), compared with subjects 18 to 45 years of age (n = 16). Subjects 65 to 75 years of age (n = 15) had no change in C max , but an approximately 32% increase in AUC, compared to subjects 18 to 45 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] .  Gender  In a study of healthy subjects administered doses of up to 300 mg, women had an approximately 25% higher C max and an approximately 10% higher AUC than age-matched men. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is needed.  Race  Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that race (White, n = 466; Black, n = 97; Hispanic, n = 39; Other, n = 33) had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of PRISTIQ. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of race is needed.  Hepatic insufficiency  The disposition of desvenlafaxine succinate after administration of 100 mg was studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A, n = 8), moderate (Child-Pugh B, n = 8), and severe (Child-Pugh C, n = 8) hepatic impairment and to healthy subjects (n = 12).  Average AUC was increased by approximately 31% and 35% in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Average AUC values were similar in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (&lt; 5% difference).  Systemic clearance (CL/F) was decreased by approximately 20% and 36% in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. CL/F values were comparable in mild hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (&lt; 5% difference).  The mean t 1/2 changed from approximately 10 hours in healthy subjects and subjects with mild hepatic impairment to 13 and 14 hours in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. The recommended dose in patients with hepatic impairment is 50 mg per day. Dose escalation above 100 mg per day is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .  Renal insufficiency  The disposition of desvenlafaxine after administration of 100 mg was studied in subjects with mild (n = 9), moderate (n = 8), severe (n = 7) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 9) requiring dialysis and in healthy, age-matched control subjects (n = 8). Elimination was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance. Increases in AUCs of about 42% in mild renal impairment (24-hr CrCl = 50 to 80 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault [C-G]), about 56% in moderate renal impairment (24-hr CrCl = 30 to 50 mL/min, C-G), about 108% in severe renal impairment (24-hr CrCl â¤30 mL/min, C-G), and about 116% in ESRD subjects were observed, compared with healthy, age-matched control subjects.  The mean terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was prolonged from 11.1 hours in the control subjects to approximately 13.5, 15.5, 17.6, and 22.8 hours in mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and ESRD subjects, respectively. Less than 5% of the drug in the body was cleared during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure.  The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment is 50 mg per day. Dosage adjustment of 50 mg every other day is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].</Section>
