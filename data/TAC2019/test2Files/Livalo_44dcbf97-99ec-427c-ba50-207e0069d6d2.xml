7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Erythromycin: Combination increases pitavastatin exposure. Limit LIVALO to 1 mg once daily ( 2.3 , 7.2 ) Rifampin: Combination increases pitavastatin exposure. Limit LIVALO to 2 mg once daily ( 2.4 , 7.3 ) Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with LIVALO. ( 5.1 , 7.4 , 7.5 ) 7.1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine significantly increased pitavastatin exposure. Co-administration of cyclosporine with LIVALO is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].  7.2 Erythromycin Erythromycin significantly increased pitavastatin exposure. In patients taking erythromycin, a dose of LIVALO 1 mg once daily should not be exceeded [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Rifampin Rifampin significantly increased pitavastatin exposure. In patients taking rifampin, a dose of LIVALO 2 mg once daily should not be exceeded [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].  7.4 Gemfibrozil Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of LIVALO with gemfibrozil should be avoided. 7.5 Other Fibrates Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, LIVALO should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.6 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when LIVALO is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in LIVALO dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].  7.7 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing LIVALO with colchicine. 7.8 Warfarin LIVALO had no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with R- and S- warfarin. LIVALO had no significant effect on prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . However, patients receiving warfarin should have their PT and INR monitored when pitavastatin is added to their therapy.</Section>

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pitavastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, which is a rate-determining enzyme involved with biosynthesis of cholesterol, in a manner of competition with the substrate so that it inhibits cholesterol synthesis in the liver. As a result, the expression of LDL-receptors followed by the uptake of LDL from blood to liver is accelerated and then the plasma TC decreases. Further, the sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver decreases levels of very low density lipoproteins. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way parallel, active-comparator study with moxifloxacin in 174 healthy participants, LIVALO was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 16 mg (4 times the recommended maximum daily dose). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Pitavastatin peak plasma concentrations are achieved about 1 hour after oral administration. Both C max and AUC 0-inf increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner for single LIVALO doses from 1 to 24 mg once daily. The absolute bioavailability of pitavastatin oral solution is 51%. Administration of LIVALO with a high fat meal (50% fat content) decreases pitavastatin C max by 43% but does not significantly reduce pitavastatin AUC. The C max and AUC of pitavastatin did not differ following evening or morning drug administration. In healthy volunteers receiving 4 mg pitavastatin, the percent change from baseline for LDL-C following evening dosing was slightly greater than that following morning dosing. Pitavastatin was absorbed in the small intestine but very little in the colon. Distribution: Pitavastatin is more than 99% protein bound in human plasma, mainly to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and the mean volume of distribution is approximately 148 L. Association of pitavastatin and/or its metabolites with the blood cells is minimal. Metabolism: Pitavastatin is marginally metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. The major metabolite in human plasma is the lactone which is formed via an ester-type pitavastatin glucuronide conjugate by uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A3 and UGT2B7). Excretion: A mean of 15% of radioactivity of orally administered, single 32 mg 14 C-labeled pitavastatin dose was excreted in urine, whereas a mean of 79% of the dose was excreted in feces within 7 days. The mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 12 hours. Race: In pharmacokinetic studies pitavastatin C max and AUC were 21 and 5% lower, respectively in Black or African American healthy volunteers compared with those of Caucasian healthy volunteers. In pharmacokinetic comparison between Caucasian volunteers and Japanese volunteers, there were no significant differences in C max and AUC. Gender: In a pharmacokinetic study which compared healthy male and female volunteers, pitavastatin C max and AUC were 60 and 54% higher, respectively in females. This had no effect on the efficacy or safety of LIVALO in women in clinical studies. Geriatric: In a pharmacokinetic study which compared healthy young and elderly (≥65 years) volunteers, pitavastatin C max and AUC were 10 and 30% higher, respectively, in the elderly. This had no effect on the efficacy or safety of LIVALO in elderly subjects in clinical studies. Renal Impairment: In patients with moderate renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate of 30 – 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and end stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis, pitavastatin AUC 0-inf is 102 and 86% higher than those of healthy volunteers, respectively, while pitavastatin C max is 60 and 40% higher than those of healthy volunteers, respectively. Patients received hemodialysis immediately before pitavastatin dosing and did not undergo hemodialysis during the pharmacokinetic study. Hemodialysis patients have 33 and 36% increases in the mean unbound fraction of pitavastatin as compared to healthy volunteers and patients with moderate renal impairment, respectively. In another pharmacokinetic study, patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 15 – 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) not receiving hemodialysis were administered a single dose of LIVALO 4 mg. The AUC 0-inf and the C max were 36 and 18% higher, respectively, compared with those of healthy volunteers. For both patients with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers, the mean percentage of protein-unbound pitavastatin was approximately 0.6%. The effect of mild renal impairment on pitavastatin exposure has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment: The disposition of pitavastatin was compared in healthy volunteers and patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment. The ratio of pitavastatin C max between patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B disease) and healthy volunteers was 2.7. The ratio of pitavastatin AUC inf between patients with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers was 3.8. The ratio of pitavastatin C max between patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A disease) and healthy volunteers was 1.3. The ratio of pitavastatin AUC inf between patients with mild hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers was 1.6. Mean pitavastatin t ½ for moderate hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment, and healthy were 15, 10, and 8 hours, respectively. Drug-Drug Interactions: The principal route of pitavastatin metabolism is glucuronidation via liver UGTs with subsequent formation of pitavastatin lactone. There is only minimal metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system. Warfarin : The steady-state pharmacodynamics (international normalized ratio [INR] and prothrombin time [PT]) and pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy volunteers were unaffected by the co-administration of LIVALO 4 mg daily. However, patients receiving warfarin should have their PT time or INR monitored when pitavastatin is added to their therapy.  Table 2.
