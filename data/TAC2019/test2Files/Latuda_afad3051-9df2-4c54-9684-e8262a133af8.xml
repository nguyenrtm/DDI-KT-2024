12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression is unclear. However, its efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine D 2 and serotonin Type 2 (5HT 2A ) receptor antagonism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Lurasidone is an antagonist with high affinity binding at the dopamine D 2 receptors (Ki of 1 nM) and the serotonin 5-HT 2A (Ki of 0.5 nM) and 5-HT 7 (Ki of 0.5 nM) receptors. It also binds with moderate affinity to the human α 2C adrenergic receptors (Ki of 11 nM), is a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT 1A (Ki of 6.4 nM) receptors, and is an antagonist at the α 2A adrenergic receptors (Ki of 41 nM). Lurasidone exhibits little or no affinity for histamine H 1 and muscarinic M 1 receptors (IC 50 &gt; 1,000 nM). ECG Changes  The effects of LATUDA on the QTc interval were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-dedicated thorough QT study in 43 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were treated with LATUDA doses of 120 mg daily, 600 mg daily and completed the study. The maximum mean (upper 1-sided, 95% CI) increase in baseline-adjusted QTc intervals based on individual correction method (QTcI) was 7.5 (11.7) ms and 4.6 (9.5) ms, for the 120 mg and 600 mg dose groups respectively, observed at 2 to 4 hours after dosing. In this study, there was no apparent dose (exposure)-response relationship. In short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar depression, no post-baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported in patients treated with LATUDA or placebo. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Adults  The activity of LATUDA is primarily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg. Steady-state concentrations of LATUDA are reached within 7 days of starting LATUDA. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) elimination half-life was 18 ( 7 ) hours. Absorption and Distribution: LATUDA is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours. It is estimated that 9-19% of an administered dose is absorbed. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L. LATUDA is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins. In a food effect study, LATUDA mean C max and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions. LATUDA exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1000 calories and was independent of meal fat content [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . In clinical studies, establishing the safety and efficacy of LATUDA, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Metabolism and Elimination: LATUDA is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative N -dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S -oxidation. LATUDA is metabolized into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two major non-active metabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Based on in vitro studies, LATUDA is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. Because LATUDA is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of LATUDA. Transporter proteins: In vitro studies suggest LATUDA is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, however, is probably a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. In vitro studies indicate that LATUDA is not expected to inhibit transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. LATUDA is not a clinically significant inhibitor of P-gp. However, it may inhibit BCRP. Total excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 89%, with about 80% recovered in feces and 9% recovered in urine, after a single dose of [ 14 C]-labeled LATUDA. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent clearance was 3902 (18.0) mL/min. Drug Interaction Studies  Effects of other drugs on the exposure of lurasidone are summarized in Figure 1 . A population PK analyses concluded that coadministration of lithium 300-2400 mg/day or valproate 300-2000 mg/day with lurasidone for up to 6 weeks has minimal effect on lurasidone exposure. And the effects of LATUDA on the exposures of other drugs are summarized in Figure 2 . A population PK analyses concluded that coadministration of lurasidone has minimal effect on lithium and valproate exposure when it is coadministered with lithium 300-2400 mg/day or valproate 300-2000 mg/day. Figure 1: Impact of Other Drugs on LATUDA Pharmacokinetics  Figure 2: Impact of LATUDA on Other Drugs  Figure 1 Figure 2 Studies in Specific Populations  The effect of intrinsic patient factors on the pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is presented in Figure 3 . Pediatric Patients  LATUDA exposure (i.e., steady-state Cmax and AUC) in children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) was generally similar to that in adults across the dose range from 40 to 160 mg, without adjusting for body weight.
