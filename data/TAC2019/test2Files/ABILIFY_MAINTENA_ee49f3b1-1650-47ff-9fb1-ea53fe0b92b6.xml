With concomitant use of ABILIFY MAINTENA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor for more than 14 days, reduce the ABILIFY MAINTENA dosage  [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)].  Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., carbamazepine)  The concomitant use of oral aripiprazole and carbamazepine decreased the exposure of aripiprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ].  Avoid use of ABILIFY MAINTENA in combination with carbamazepine and other inducers of CYP3A4 for greater than 14 days [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] .  Antihypertensive Drugs  Due to its alpha adrenergic antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.  Monitor blood pressure and adjust dose accordingly [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ].  Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam)  The intensity of sedation was greater with the combination of oral aripiprazole and lorazepam as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. The orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ].  Monitor sedation and blood pressure. Adjust dose accordingly.  7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ABILIFY MAINTENA  Based on pharmacokinetic studies with oral aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment of ABILIFY MAINTENA is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, lithium, lorazepam [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] .  In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with ABILIFY MAINTENA. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, lorazepam, or sertraline when co-administered with ABILIFY MAINTENA.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  12.1 Mechanism of Action  The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is unknown.  The efficacy of aripiprazole could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT 2A receptors.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics  Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D 2 and D 3 (K i s 0.34 and 0.8 nM respectively), serotonin 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors (K i s 1.7 and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D 4 , serotonin 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 7 , alpha 1 -adrenergic and histamine H 1 receptors (K i s of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (K i= 98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC 50 &gt;1000 nM). Actions at receptors other than D 2 , 5-HT 1A , and 5-HT 2A could explain some of the other adverse reactions of aripiprazole (e.g., the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha 1 receptors).  Alcohol  There was no significant difference between oral aripiprazole co-administered with ethanol and placebo co-administered with ethanol on performance of gross motor skills or stimulus response in healthy subjects. As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY MAINTENA.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics  ABILIFY MAINTENA activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D 2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents about 29% of the parent drug exposure in plasma.  Aripiprazole absorption into the systemic circulation is slow and prolonged following intramuscular injection due to low solubility of aripiprazole particles. Following a single dose administration of ABILIFY MAINTENA in the deltoid and gluteal muscle, the extent of absorption (AUCt, AUC∞) of aripiprazole was similar for both injection sites, but the rate of absorption (Cmax) was 31% higher following administration to the deltoid compared to the gluteal site. However, at steady state, AUC and Cmax were similar for both sites of injection. Following multiple intramuscular doses, the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole gradually rise to maximum plasma concentrations at a median T max of 5 - 7 days for the gluteal muscle and 4 days for the deltoid muscle. After gluteal administration, the mean apparent aripiprazole terminal elimination half-life was 29.9 days and 46.5 days after multiple injections for every 4-week injection of ABILIFY MAINTENA 300 mg and 400 mg, respectively. Steady state concentrations for the typical subject were attained by the fourth dose for both sites of administration. Approximate dose-proportional increases in aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole exposure were observed after every four week ABILIFY MAINTENA injections of 300 mg and 400 mg.  Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes. Aripiprazole also does not undergo direct glucuronidation.  Drug Interaction Studies  No specific drug interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY MAINTENA. The information below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole.  Effects of other drugs on the exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are summarized in Figure 19 and Figure 20, respectively. Based on simulation, a 4.5-fold increase in mean C max and AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. After oral administration, a 3-fold increase in mean C max and AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Figure 19: The effects of other drugs on aripiprazole pharmacokinetics  Figure 20: The effects of other drugs on dehydro-aripiprazole pharmacokinetics  The effects of ABILIFY on the exposures of other drugs are summarized in Figure 21. A population PK analysis in patients with major depressive disorder showed no substantial change in plasma concentrations of fluoxetine (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day), paroxetine CR (37.5 mg/day or 50 mg/day), or sertraline (100 mg/day or 150 mg/day) dosed to steady-state. The steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine increased by about 18% and 36%, respectively, and concentrations of paroxetine decreased by about 27%. The steady-state plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were not substantially changed when these antidepressant therapies were coadministered with aripiprazole.  Figure 21: The effects of oral aripiprazole on pharmacokinetics of other drugs  Figure19  Figure 20  Figure 21  Studies in Specific Populations  No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with ABILIFY MAINTENA in specific populations. All the information is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole.  Exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in specific populations are summarized in Figure 22 and Figure 23, respectively. In addition, in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) administered with oral aripiprazole (20 mg to 30 mg), the body weight corrected aripiprazole clearance was similar to the adults.
