2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

 PAH in patients with NYHA Class II-IV symptoms: 

 Initial dose for patients new to prostacyclin infusion therapy: 1.25 ng/kg/min; increase based on clinical response (increments of 1.25 ng/kg/min per week for the first 4 weeks of treatment, later 2.5 ng/kg/min per week). Avoid abrupt cessation. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 
 Mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency: Decrease initial dose to 0.625 ng/kg/min. Severe hepatic insufficiency: No studies performed. ( 2.4 ) 

 Transition from Flolan: 

 Increase the Remodulin dose gradually as the Flolan dose is decreased, based on constant observation of response. ( 2.6 ) 

 Administration: Continuous subcutaneous infusion (undiluted) is the preferred mode. Use intravenous (IV) infusion (dilution required) if subcutaneous infusion is not tolerated. ( 2.1 , 2.5 ) 

 2.1 General 

 Remodulin can be administered without further dilution for subcutaneous administration, or diluted for intravenous infusion with Sterile Diluent for Remodulin or similar approved high-pH glycine diluent (e.g. Sterile Diluent for Flolan or Sterile Diluent for Epoprostenol Sodium), Sterile Water for Injection, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection prior to administration. See Table 1 below for storage and administration time limits for the different diluents.

 2.2 Initial Dose for Patients New to Prostacyclin Infusion Therapy 

 Remodulin is indicated for subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) use only as a continuous infusion. Remodulin is preferably infused subcutaneously, but can be administered by a central intravenous line if the subcutaneous route is not tolerated, because of severe site pain or reaction. The infusion rate is initiated at 1.25 ng/kg/min. If this initial dose cannot be tolerated because of systemic effects, reduce the infusion rate to 0.625 ng/kg/min. 

 2.3 Dosage Adjustments 

 The goal of chronic dosage adjustments is to establish a dose at which PAH symptoms are improved, while minimizing excessive pharmacologic effects of Remodulin (headache, nausea, emesis, restlessness, anxiety and infusion site pain or reaction). 
 The infusion rate should be increased in increments of 1.25 ng/kg/min per week for the first four weeks of treatment and then 2.5 ng/kg/min per week for the remaining duration of infusion, depending on clinical response. Dosage adjustments may be undertaken more often if tolerated. Avoid abrupt cessation of infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Restarting a Remodulin infusion within a few hours after an interruption can be done using the same dose rate. Interruptions for longer periods may require the dose of Remodulin to be re-titrated. 

 2.4 Patients with Hepatic Insufficiency 

 In patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency, decrease the initial dose of Remodulin to 0.625 ng/kg/min ideal body weight. Remodulin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use In Specific Populations (8.6) 
 and 
 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 

 2.5 Administration 

 Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If either particulate matter or discoloration is noted, do not use. 

 Subcutaneous Infusion 

 Remodulin is administered subcutaneously by continuous infusion without further dilution, via a subcutaneous catheter, using an infusion pump designed for subcutaneous drug delivery. To avoid potential interruptions in drug delivery, the patient must have immediate access to a backup infusion pump and subcutaneous infusion sets. The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer Remodulin should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) be adjustable to approximately 0.002 mL/hr, (3) have occlusion/no delivery, low battery, programming error and motor malfunction alarms, (4) have delivery accuracy of ±6% or better and (5) be positive pressure driven. The reservoir should be made of polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene or glass. 
 Remodulin is administered subcutaneously by continuous infusion at a calculated subcutaneous infusion rate (mL/hr) based on a patient's dose (ng/kg/min), weight (kg), and the vial strength (mg/mL) of Remodulin being used. During use, a single reservoir (syringe) of undiluted Remodulin can be administered up to 72 hours at 37°C. The subcutaneous infusion rate is calculated using the following formula:

 Intravenous Infusion 

 Diluted Remodulin is administered intravenously by continuous infusion via a surgically placed indwelling central venous catheter using an infusion pump designed for intravenous drug delivery. If clinically necessary, a temporary peripheral intravenous cannula, preferably placed in a large vein, may be used for short term administration of Remodulin. Use of a peripheral intravenous infusion for more than a few hours may be associated with an increased risk of thrombophlebitis. To avoid potential interruptions in drug delivery, the patient must have immediate access to a backup infusion pump and infusion sets. The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer Remodulin should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) have occlusion/no delivery, low battery, programming error and motor malfunction alarms, (3) have delivery accuracy of ±6% or better of the hourly dose, and (4) be positive pressure driven. The reservoir should be made of polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene or glass. 

 Infusion sets with an in-line 0.22 or 0.2 micron pore size filter should be used. 

 Diluted Remodulin has been shown to be stable at ambient temperature when stored for up to 14 days using high-pH glycine diluent at concentrations as low as 0.004 mg/mL (4,000 ng/mL). 

 Select the intravenous infusion rate to allow for a desired infusion period length of up to 48 hours between system changeovers. Typical intravenous infusion system reservoirs have volumes of 50 or 100 mL. With this selected intravenous infusion rate (mL/hr) and the patient's dose (ng/kg/min) and weight (kg), the diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration (mg/mL) can be calculated using the following formula: 

 Step 1

 =

 The volume of Remodulin Injection needed to make the required diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration for the given reservoir size can then be calculated using the following formula:

 (mg/mL) 

 The calculated volume of Remodulin Injection is then added to the reservoir along with the sufficient volume of diluent to achieve the desired total volume in the reservoir. 
 Example calculations for Intravenous Infusion are as follows: 

 Example 3: 

 For a 60 kg person at a dose of 5 ng/kg/min, with a predetermined intravenous infusion rate of 1 mL/hr and a reservoir of 50 mL, the diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration would be calculated as follows: 

 Step 1 

 Diluted Intravenous Remodulin Concentration 
 (mg/mL) 

 = 

 5 ng/kg/min 

 × 

 60 kg 

 × 

 0.00006 

 = 0.018 mg/mL (18,000 ng/mL) 

 1 mL/hr 

 The volume of Remodulin Injection (using 1 mg/mL Vial Strength) needed for a total diluted Remodulin concentration of 0.018 mg/mL and a total volume of 50 mL would be calculated as follows: 

 Step 2 

 Volume of Remodulin Injection 
 (mL) 
 = 

 0.018 mg/mL 
 × 50 mL = 0.9 mL 

 1 mg/mL 

 The diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration for the person in Example 3 would thus be prepared by adding 0.9 mL of 1 mg/mL Remodulin Injection to a suitable reservoir along with a sufficient volume of diluent to achieve a total volume of 50 mL in the reservoir. The pump flow rate for this example would be set at 1 mL/hr. 

 Example 4: 

 For a 75 kg person at a dose of 30 ng/kg/min, with a predetermined intravenous infusion rate of 2 mL/hr, and a reservoir of 100 mL, the diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration would be calculated as follows: 

 Step 1 

 Diluted Intravenous Remodulin Concentration 
 (mg/mL) 

 = 

 30 ng/kg/min 

 × 

 75 kg 

 × 

 0.00006 

 = 0.0675 mg/mL (67,500 ng/mL) 

 2 mL/hr 

 The volume of Remodulin Injection (using 2.5 mg/mL Vial Strength) needed for a total diluted Remodulin concentration of 0.0675 mg/mL and a total volume of 100 mL would be calculated as follows: 

 Step 2 

 Volume of Remodulin Injection 
 (mL) 
 = 

 0.0675 mg/mL 
 × 100 mL = 2.7 mL 

 2.5 mg/mL 

 The diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration for the person in Example 4 would thus be prepared by adding 2.7 mL of 2.5 mg/mL Remodulin Injection to a suitable reservoir along with a sufficient volume of diluent to achieve a total volume of 100 mL in the reservoir. The pump flow rate for this example would be set at 2 mL/hr. 

 2.6 Patients Requiring Transition from Flolan 

 Transition from Flolan to Remodulin is accomplished by initiating the infusion of Remodulin and increasing it, while simultaneously reducing the dose of intravenous Flolan. The transition to Remodulin should take place in a hospital with constant observation of response (e.g., walk distance and signs and symptoms of disease progression). Initiate Remodulin at a recommended dose of 10% of the current Flolan dose, and then escalate as the Flolan dose is decreased (see Table 2 for recommended dose titrations). 
 Patients are individually titrated to a dose that allows transition from Flolan therapy to Remodulin while balancing prostacyclin-limiting adverse events. Increases in the patient's symptoms of PAH should be first treated with increases in the dose of Remodulin. Side effects normally associated with prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs are to be first treated by decreasing the dose of Flolan.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 

 For intravenous infusion use an indwelling central venous catheter. This route is associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. ( 5.1 ) 
 Do not abruptly lower the dose or withdraw dosing. ( 5.2 ) 

 5.1 Risk of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection 

 Chronic intravenous infusions of Remodulin are delivered using an indwelling central venous catheter. This route is associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. Therefore, continuous subcutaneous infusion (undiluted) is the preferred mode of administration. 
 In an open-label study of IV treprostinil (n=47), there were seven catheter-related line infections during approximately 35 patient years, or about 1 BSI event per 5 years of use. A CDC survey of seven sites that used IV treprostinil for the treatment of PAH found approximately 1 BSI (defined as any positive blood culture) event per 3 years of use. Administration of IV Remodulin with a high pH glycine diluent has been associated with a lower incidence of BSIs when compared to neutral diluents (sterile water, 0.9% sodium chloride) when used along with catheter care guidelines. 

 5.2 Worsening PAH upon Abrupt Withdrawal or Sudden Large Dose Reduction 

 Avoid abrupt withdrawal or sudden large reductions in dosage of Remodulin, which may result in worsening of PAH symptoms. 

 5.3 Patients with Hepatic or Renal Insufficiency 

 Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, because such patients will likely be exposed to greater systemic concentrations relative to patients with normal hepatic or renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5) , Use In Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 

 5.4 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil 

 Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) increases exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) decreases exposure to treprostinil [see Drug Interactions (7.5) 
 and 
 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 

 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been conducted with treprostinil administered subcutaneously (Remodulin) and orally (treprostinil diethanolamine). 

 Pharmacodynamics 

 Blood pressure lowering drugs (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or vasodilators): Risk of increased reduction in blood pressure ( 7.1 ) 
 Remodulin inhibits platelet aggregation. Potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients on anticoagulants. ( 7.2 ) 
 Remodulin dosage adjustment may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. ( 7.6 ) 

 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents or Other Vasodilators 

 Concomitant administration of Remodulin with diuretics, antihypertensive agents or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension. 

 7.2 Anticoagulants 

 Since treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation, there may be an increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants. 

 Pharmacokinetics 

 7.3 Bosentan 

 In a human pharmacokinetic study conducted with bosentan (250 mg/day) and an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine), no pharmacokinetic interactions between treprostinil and bosentan were observed. 

 7.4 Sildenafil 

 In a human pharmacokinetic study conducted with sildenafil (60 mg/day) and an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine), no pharmacokinetic interactions between treprostinil and sildenafil were observed. 

 7.5 Effect of Treprostinil on Cytochrome P450 Enzymes 

 In vitro studies of human hepatic microsomes showed that treprostinil does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. Additionally, treprostinil does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Thus Remodulin is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds metabolized by CYP enzymes. 

 7.6 Effect of Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers on Treprostinil 

 Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to treprostinil. It has not been determined if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the parenteral (subcutaneously or intravenously) route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 
 Remodulin has not been studied in conjunction with Flolan or Tracleer ® (bosentan). 

 7.7 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil 

 Drug interaction studies have been carried out with treprostinil (oral or subcutaneous) co-administered with acetaminophen (4 g/day), warfarin (25 mg/day), and fluconazole (200 mg/day), respectively in healthy volunteers. These studies did not show a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil. Treprostinil does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. The pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin and the INR in healthy subjects given a single 25 mg dose of warfarin were unaffected by continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil at an infusion rate of 10 ng/kg/min.</Section>
