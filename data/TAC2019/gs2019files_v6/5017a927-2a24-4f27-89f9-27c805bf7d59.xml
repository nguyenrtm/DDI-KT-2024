Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients who are anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: Use of indwelling epidural catheters Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, and other anticoagulants A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery Optimal timing between the administration of Lovenox and neuraxial procedures is not known Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

<Section name="DOSAGE &amp;amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
See full prescribing information for dosing and administration information. ( 2 ) Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting Lovenox treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed. Abdominal Surgery The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery The recommended dose of Lovenox is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . A dose of Lovenox of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (±3) hours prior to surgery. Medical Patients During Acute Illness The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting. The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment). In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox). Continue Lovenox for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with Lovenox for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction The recommended dose of Lovenox is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer Lovenox between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of Lovenox therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge. For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of Lovenox [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &amp;lt;30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 1: Dosage Regimens for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment (creatinine clearance &amp;lt;30 mL/minute) Indication Dosage Regimen Prophylaxis in abdominal surgery 30 mg administered subcutaneously once daily Prophylaxis in hip or knee replacement surgery 30 mg administered subcutaneously once daily Prophylaxis in medical patients during acute illness 30 mg administered subcutaneously once daily Inpatient treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily Outpatient treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily Prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non–Q-wave myocardial infarction, when concurrently administered with aspirin 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in patients &amp;lt;75 years of age, when administered in conjunction with aspirin 30 mg single intravenous bolus plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in geriatric patients ≥75 years of age, when administered in conjunction with aspirin 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily (no initial bolus) Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding. For treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in geriatric patients ≥75 years of age, do not use an initial intravenous bolus . Initiate dosing with 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 75 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 0.75 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment is necessary for other indications in geriatric patients unless kidney function is impaired [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Do not administer Lovenox by intramuscular injection. Administer Lovenox by intravenous or subcutaneous injection only. Lovenox is a clear, colorless to pale yellow sterile solution, and as with other parenteral drug products, should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use a tuberculin syringe or equivalent when using Lovenox multiple-dose vials to assure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. Patients may self-inject by the subcutaneous route of administration only after their physicians determine that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up, as necessary. Provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique before allowing self-injection (with or without the assistance of an injection device). Subcutaneous Injection Technique Position patients in a supine position for Lovenox administration by deep subcutaneous injection. Do not expel the air bubble from the prefilled syringes before the injection, to avoid the loss of drug. Alternate injection sites between the left and right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall. Introduce the whole length of the needle into a skin fold held between the thumb and forefinger; hold the skin fold throughout the injection. To minimize bruising, do not rub the injection site after completion of the injection. Lovenox prefilled syringes and graduated prefilled syringes are for single, one-time use only and are available with a system that shields the needle after injection. Remove the prefilled syringe from the blister packaging by peeling at the arrow as directed on the blister. Do not remove by pulling on the plunger as this may damage the syringe. Remove the needle shield by pulling it straight off the syringe (see Figure A ). If less than the full syringe volume is needed to administer the prescribed dose, eject syringe contents until the prescribed dose is left in the syringe. Figure A Inject using standard technique, pushing the plunger to the bottom of the syringe (see Figure B ). Figure B Remove the syringe from the injection site keeping your finger on the plunger rod (see Figure C ). Figure C Orient the needle away from you and others, and activate the safety system by firmly pushing the plunger rod. The protective sleeve will automatically cover the needle and an audible "click" will be heard to confirm shield activation (see Figure D ). Figure D Immediately dispose of the syringe in the nearest sharps container (see Figure E ). Figure E NOTE: The safety system can only be activated once the syringe has been emptied. Activation of the safety system must be done only after removing the needle from the patient's skin. Do not replace the needle shield after injection. The safety system should not be sterilized. Activation of the safety system may cause minimal splatter of fluid. For optimal safety, activate the system while orienting it downwards away from yourself and others. Figure A Figure B Figure C Figure D Figure E Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer Lovenox through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister Lovenox with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Lovenox, to prevent mixing of drugs. Lovenox is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood. Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding. In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox. If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
Whenever possible, agents which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of Lovenox therapy. These agents include medications such as: anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid, salicylates, NSAIDs (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone. If coadministration is essential, conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Discontinue agents which may enhance hemorrhage risk prior to initiation of Lovenox or conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring. ( 2.6 , 7 )</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
Increased Risk of Hemorrhage: Monitor for signs of bleeding. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis. ( 5.4 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count closely. ( 5.5 ) Interchangeability with other heparins: Do not exchange with heparin or other LMWHs. ( 5.6 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves: Women and their fetuses may be at increased risk. Monitor more frequently and adjust dosage as needed. ( 5.7 ) Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning , Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second Lovenox dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance &amp;lt;30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Lovenox is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. Use Lovenox with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors. Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported. Some of these cases have been fatal. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Lovenox. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non–Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox doses. It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous Lovenox. If the treatment with Lovenox is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Lovenox should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage. Lovenox may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. Use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Circulating antibodies may persist for several years. Only use Lovenox in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Lovenox in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered. Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm 3 and 50,000/mm 3 ) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials. Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm 3 occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 , Lovenox should be discontinued. Lovenox cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use. Use of Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may result in valve thrombosis. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves given Lovenox (1 mg/kg twice daily) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal and fetal death. No patients in the heparin/warfarin group (0 of 4 women) died. There also have been isolated postmarketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis. Women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy and, when pregnant, have a higher rate of fetal loss from stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery. Therefore, frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-Factor Xa levels, and adjusting of dosage may be needed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Lovenox multiple-dose vials are not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Lovenox multiple-dose vials. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Lovenox multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, if anticoagulation with Lovenox is needed during pregnancy, use the preservative-free formulations where possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin which has antithrombotic properties. In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ±SD, 14.0±3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean ±SD, 1.22±0.13). Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n=1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4. Absorption Pharmacokinetic trials were conducted using the 100 mg/mL formulation. Maximum anti-Factor Xa and anti-thrombin (anti-Factor IIa) activities occur 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin. Mean peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 0.16 IU/mL (1.58 mcg/mL) and 0.38 IU/mL (3.83 mcg/mL) after the 20 mg and the 40 mg clinically tested subcutaneous doses, respectively. Mean (n=46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days. Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 100% in healthy subjects. A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours provided initial peak anti-Factor Xa levels of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 84% of steady-state levels. Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment. Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40 mg once daily and 1.5 mg/kg once-daily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose. Steady-state enoxaparin activity levels are well predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 1 mg/kg twice-daily regimen, the steady state is reached from day 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single dose and mean peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively. Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range. Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose. When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained (see Table 13 ). Table 13: Pharmacokinetic Parameters Means ±SD at Day 5 and 90% Confidence Interval (CI) of the ratio After 5 Days of 1.5 mg/kg Subcutaneous Once-Daily Doses of Enoxaparin Sodium Using 100 mg/mL or 200 mg/mL Concentrations Concentration Anti-Xa Anti-IIa Heptest aPTT A max (IU/mL or Δ sec) 100 mg/mL 1.37 (±0.23) 0.23 (±0.05) 105 (±17) 19 (±5) 200 mg/mL 1.45 (±0.22) 0.26 (±0.05) 111 (±17) 22 (±7) 90% CI 102%–110% 102%–111% t max Median (range) (h) 100 mg/mL 3 (2–6) 4 (2–5) 2.5 (2–4.5) 3 (2–4.5) 200 mg/mL 3.5 (2–6) 4.5 (2.5–6) 3.3 (2–5) 3 (2–5) AUC (ss) (h*IU/mL or h* Δ sec) 100 mg/mL 14.26 (±2.93) 1.54 (±0.61) 1321 (±219) 200 mg/mL 15.43 (±2.96) 1.77 (±0.67) 1401 (±227) 90% CI 105%–112% 103%–109% Distribution The volume of distribution of anti-Factor Xa activity is about 4.3 L. Elimination Following intravenous dosing, the total body clearance of enoxaparin is 26 mL/min. After intravenous dosing of enoxaparin labeled with the gamma-emitter, 99m Tc, 40% of radioactivity and 8 to 20% of anti-Factor Xa activity were recovered in urine in 24 hours. Elimination half-life based on anti-Factor Xa activity was 4.5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about 7 hours after repeated dosing. Significant anti-Factor Xa activity persists in plasma for about 12 hours following a 40 mg subcutaneous once a day dose. Following subcutaneous dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min. Metabolism Enoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. Special Populations Gender Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor. Geriatric Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Renal impairment A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to &amp;lt;50 mL/min renal impairment after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &amp;lt;30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7 )] . Hemodialysis In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose. Hepatic impairment Studies with Lovenox in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown. Weight After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30–48 kg/m 2 ) compared to non-obese control subjects, while A max is not increased. When non–weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (&amp;lt;45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (&amp;lt;57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] . Pharmacokinetic Interaction No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between Lovenox and thrombolytics when administered concomitantly.</Section>
