In patients taking LYSODREN, adrenal crisis occurs in the setting of shock or severe trauma and response to shock is impaired. Administer hydrocortisone, monitor for escalating signs of shock and discontinue LYSODREN until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

•Initial dose: 2 g to 6 g orally daily, in three or four divided doses. (2.1) •Increase dose incrementally to achieve a blood concentration of 14 to 20 mg/L, or as tolerated. (2.1) The recommended initial dose of LYSODREN is 2 g to 6 g orally, in three or four divided doses per day. Increase doses incrementally to achieve a blood concentration of 14 to 20 mg/L, or as tolerated. LYSODREN is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. Discontinue LYSODREN until recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Discontinue LYSODREN until symptoms resolve. Seven to 10 days after symptoms resolve, restart at a lower dose (for example, decrease by 500-1000 mg) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
Adjust dosage of concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulants as needed. (7.2) Mitotane is a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements for the concomitant drug when administering LYSODREN to patients receiving drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. When administering coumarin-type anticoagulants to patients receiving LYSODREN, monitor coagulation tests and adjust the anticoagulant dose as needed.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
•Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity: Plasma concentrations exceeding 20 mcg/mL are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. (5.2) •Adrenal Insufficiency: Institute steroid replacement as clinically indicated. Measure free cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) levels to achieve optimal steroid replacement. (5.3) •Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) •Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women: Advise women to seek medical advice if they experience gynecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain. ( 5.5 ) In patients taking LYSODREN, adrenal crisis occurs in the setting of shock or severe trauma and response to shock is impaired. Administer hydrocortisone, monitor for escalating signs of shock, and discontinue LYSODREN until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CNS toxicity, including sedation, lethargy, and vertigo, occurs with LYSODREN treatment. Mitotane plasma concentrations exceeding 20 mcg/mL are associated with a greater incidence of toxicity. Treatment with LYSODREN can cause adrenal insufficiency. Institute steroid replacement as clinically indicated. Measure free cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) levels to achieve optimal steroid replacement. LYSODREN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm births and early pregnancy loss, can occur in patients exposed to mitotane during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LYSODREN and after discontinuation of treatment for as long as mitotane plasma levels are detectable [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 ,  8.3) ]. Ovarian macrocysts, often bilateral and multiple, have been reported in premenopausal patients receiving LYSODREN. Complications from these cysts, including adnexal torsion and hemorrhagic cyst rupture, have been reported. In some cases, improvement after mitotane discontinuation has been described. Advise female patients to seek medical care if they experience gynecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain [seeAdverse Reactions (6)].</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
Mitotane is an adrenal cytotoxic agent with an unknown mechanism of action. Mitotane modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids and directly suppresses the adrenal cortex. A reduction in 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the absence of decreased corticosteroid concentrations and increased formation of 6-β-hydroxycortisol have been reported. The pharmacodynamics of mitotane are unknown. Following oral administration of LYSODREN, 40% of the dose is absorbed. Mitotane is found in most tissues of the body; however, fat is the primary site of distribution. Following discontinuation of mitotane, the plasma terminal half-life ranges from 18 to 159 days (median 53 days). Mitotane is converted to a water-soluble metabolite. No unchanged mitotane is found in urine or bile. Approximately 10% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite. A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile.</Section>
