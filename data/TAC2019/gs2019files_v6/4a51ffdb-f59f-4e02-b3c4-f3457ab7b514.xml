MESNEX is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to mesna or to any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. • Known hypersensitivity to mesna or to any of the excipients in MESNEX, including benzyl alcohol. ( 4 )</Section>
<Section name="DOSAGE &amp;amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
MESNEX may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections or a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of MESNEX tablets as outlined below. The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is adjusted, the ratio of MESNEX to ifosfamide should be maintained. ( 2 ) Intravenous Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -- -- MESNEX injection 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule: 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 -- -- MESNEX injection 240 mg/m 2 -- -- MESNEX tablets -- 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 Maintain sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. ( 2.3 ) MESNEX may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of three bolus intravenous injections as outlined below. MESNEX injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage weight by weight (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration and 4 and 8 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of MESNEX is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined below in Table 1. Table 1. Recommended Intravenous Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 4 Hours 8 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 – – MESNEX injection The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of MESNEX to ifosfamide should be maintained. 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 240 mg/m 2 MESNEX may be given on a fractionated dosing schedule of a single bolus injection followed by two oral administrations of MESNEX tablets as outlined below. MESNEX injection is given as intravenous bolus injections in a dosage equal to 20% of the ifosfamide dosage (w/w) at the time of ifosfamide administration. MESNEX tablets are given orally in a dosage equal to 40% of the ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 hours after each dose of ifosfamide. The total daily dose of MESNEX is 100% of the ifosfamide dose. The recommended dosing schedule is outlined in Table 2. Table 2. Recommended Intravenous and Oral Dosing Schedule 0 Hours 2 Hours 6 Hours Ifosfamide 1.2 g/m 2 – – MESNEX injection The dosing schedule should be repeated on each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of ifosfamide is increased or decreased, the ratio of MESNEX to ifosfamide should be maintained. 240 mg/m 2 – – MESNEX tablets – 480 mg/m 2 480 mg/m 2 The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral MESNEX has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g/m 2 . Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral MESNEX should repeat the dose or receive intravenous MESNEX. Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output, as required for ifosfamide treatment, and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria. If severe hematuria develops when MESNEX is given according to the recommended dosage schedule, dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required. Preparation Determine the volume of MESNEX injection for the intended dose. Dilute the volume of MESNEX injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL: • 5% Dextrose Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP • Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP Stability The MESNEX injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture. Store diluted solutions at 25°C (77°F). Use diluted solutions within 24 hours. Do not mix MESNEX injection with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, and nitrogen mustard. The benzyl alcohol contained in MESNEX injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Ifosfamide and MESNEX may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg/mL. Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with MESNEX and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Any solutions which are discolored, hazy, or contain visible particulate matter should not be used.</Section>

<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
• Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) • Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) • Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including MESNEX injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) • Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) MESNEX may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. MESNEX may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the “gasping syndrome” occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with “gasping syndrome” and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. MESNEX injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid MESNEX may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman’s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. MESNEX is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to MESNEX.</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide forming a non-urotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder. Absorption Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1.5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna (mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides), respectively. Oral bioavailability averaged 58% (range 45 to 71%) for free mesna and 89% (range 74 to 104%) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses. Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered MESNEX. Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution (V d ) for mesna is 0.652 ± 0.242 L/kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water (plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular water). Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine-cystine system, mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide (dimesna). Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration. Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose, approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. Mean plasma elimination half-lives of mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1.23 L/h/kg.</Section>
