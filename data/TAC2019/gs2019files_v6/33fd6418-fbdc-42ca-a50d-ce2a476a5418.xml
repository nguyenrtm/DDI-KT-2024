( 2.3 ) Recommended dosage in renally impaired adult patients: Creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30–49 mL/min: 300 mg every 48 hours. ( 2.4 ) CrCl 10–29 mL/min: 300 mg every 72 to 96 hours. ( 2.4 ) Hemodialysis: 300 mg every 7 days or after approximately 12 hours of dialysis. ( 2.4 ) Prior to or when initiating VIREAD, test patients for HBV infection and HIV-1 infection. VIREAD alone should not be used in patients with HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Prior to initiation and during use of VIREAD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The recommended dosage of VIREAD in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg is one 300 mg tablet taken orally once daily without regard to food . The dosage for VIREAD is the same for both HIV and HBV indications. The recommended dosage of VIREAD tablet in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing at least 17 kg is 8 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) per kg of body weight (up to a maximum of 300 mg) once daily. Dosage for pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing between 17 kg and 35 kg and able to swallow an intact tablet is provided in Table 1. Weight should be monitored periodically and the VIREAD dose adjusted accordingly. Table 1 Recommended Dosing for Patients 2 Years and Older and Weighing at Least 17 kg Using VIREAD Tablets Body Weight (kg) Dosing of VIREAD Tablets 17 to less than 22 one 150 mg tablet once daily 22 to less than 28 one 200 mg tablet once daily 28 to less than 35 one 250 mg tablet once daily at least 35 one 300 mg tablet once daily The recommended dosage of VIREAD oral powder in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing at least 10 kg who are unable to swallow a tablet is 8 mg of TDF per kg of body weight (up to a maximum of 300 mg) once daily administered as oral powder (see Table 2 ). Weight should be monitored periodically and the VIREAD dose adjusted accordingly. VIREAD oral powder should be measured only with the supplied dosing scoop. One level scoop delivers 1 g of powder, which contains 40 mg of TDF. VIREAD oral powder should be mixed in a container with 2 to 4 ounces of soft food not requiring chewing (e.g., applesauce, baby food, yogurt). The entire mixture should be ingested immediately to avoid a bitter taste. Do not administer VIREAD oral powder in a liquid as the powder may float on top of the liquid even after stirring. Further patient instructions on how to administer VIREAD oral powder with the supplied dosing scoop are provided in the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Dose reduction and close monitoring for didanosine toxicity are warranted. ( 7.2 ) Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations. When coadministered with VIREAD, use atazanavir given with ritonavir. ( 7.2 ) Coadministration of VIREAD with certain HIV-1 protease inhibitors or certain drugs to treat HCV increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. ( 7.2 ) Consult Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important drug interactions. ( 7.2 ) Tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Coadministration of VIREAD with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of tenofovir and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of tenofovir. In the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, VIREAD should not be administered in combination with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil). Table 12 provides a listing of established or clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with TDF [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 12 Established and Significant This table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration ↑=Increase, ↓=Decrease Clinical Comment NRTI: didanosine ↑ didanosine Patients receiving VIREAD and didanosine should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Discontinue didanosine in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving VIREAD with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, reduce the didanosine dose to 250 mg when it is coadministered with VIREAD. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, reduce the didanosine dose to 200 mg when it is coadministered with VIREAD. When coadministered, VIREAD and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor s: atazanavir ↓ atazanavir When coadministered with VIREAD, atazanavir 300 mg should be given with ritonavir 100 mg. lopinavir/ritonavir atazanavir/ritonavir darunavir/ritonavir ↑ tenofovir Monitor patients receiving VIREAD concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, or ritonavir-boosted darunavir for TDF-associated adverse reactions. Discontinue VIREAD in patients who develop TDF-associated adverse reactions. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents: sofosbuvir/velpatasvir sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir ↑ tenofovir Monitor patients receiving VIREAD concomitantly with EPCLUSA ® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) for adverse reactions associated with TDF. ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Monitor patients receiving VIREAD concomitantly with HARVONI ® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) without an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, for adverse reactions associated with TDF. In patients receiving VIREAD concomitantly with HARVONI and an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy, as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for adverse reactions associated with TDF.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Avoid administering VIREAD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. ( 5.2 ) HIV testing: HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with VIREAD. VIREAD should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in HIV-infected patients with or without HBV coinfection. ( 5.3 ) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ( 5.4 ) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. ( 5.5 ) Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. ( 5.6 ) All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating VIREAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including VIREAD, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue VIREAD should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Prior to initiation and during use of VIREAD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Dosing interval adjustment of VIREAD and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received VIREAD using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of VIREAD therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. VIREAD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction. Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, VIREAD should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen. HIV-1 antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with VIREAD. It is also recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B before initiating treatment with VIREAD. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIREAD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Bone Mineral Density In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, VIREAD was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. Clinical trials evaluating VIREAD in pediatric subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the VIREAD-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic HBV-infected pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age. In all pediatric trials, normal skeletal growth (height) was not affected for the duration of the clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adults and pediatric subjects 2 years and older are unknown. The long-term effect of lower spine and total body BMD on skeletal growth in pediatric patients, and in particular, the effects of long-duration exposure in younger children is unknown. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with VIREAD use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF-containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with VIREAD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). The concomitant use of VIREAD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. See Table 12 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with VIREAD; review concomitant medications during therapy with VIREAD; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. The pharmacokinetics of TDF have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and HIV-1 infected individuals. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar between these populations. Absorption VIREAD is a water soluble diester prodrug of the active ingredient tenofovir. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from VIREAD in fasted subjects is approximately 25%. Following oral administration of a single dose of VIREAD 300 mg to HIV-1 infected subjects in the fasted state, maximum serum concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 1.0 ± 0.4 hrs. C max and AUC values are 0.30 ± 0.09 µg/mL and 2.29 ± 0.69 µg ∙ hr/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir are dose proportional over a VIREAD dose range of 75 to 600 mg and are not affected by repeated dosing. In a single-dose bioequivalence study conducted under non-fasted conditions (dose administered with 4 oz. applesauce) in healthy adult volunteers, the mean C max of tenofovir was 26% lower for the oral powder relative to the tablet formulation. Mean AUC of tenofovir was similar between the oral powder and tablet formulations. Distribution In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum proteins is less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/mL. The volume of distribution at steady-state is 1.3 ± 0.6 L/kg and 1.2 ± 0.4 L/kg, following intravenous administration of tenofovir 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg. Metabolism and Elimination In vitro studies indicate that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates of CYP enzymes. Following IV administration of tenofovir, approximately 70–80% of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged tenofovir within 72 hours of dosing. Following single dose, oral administration of VIREAD, the terminal elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 17 hours. After multiple oral doses of VIREAD 300 mg once daily (under fed conditions), 32 ± 10% of the administered dose is recovered in urine over 24 hours. Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated. Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Administration of VIREAD 300 mg tablets following a high-fat meal (~700 to 1,000 kcal containing 40 to 50% fat) increases the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC 0–∞ of approximately 40% and an increase in C max of approximately 14%. However, administration of VIREAD with a light meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir when compared to fasted administration of the drug. Food delays the time to tenofovir C max by approximately 1 hour. C max and AUC of tenofovir are 0.33 ± 0.12 µg/mL and 3.32 ± 1.37 µg ∙ hr/mL following multiple doses of VIREAD 300 mg once daily in the fed state, when meal content was not controlled. Specific Populations Race There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations. Gender Tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female subjects. Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older: Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 31 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age (Table 13). Tenofovir exposure achieved in these pediatric subjects receiving oral once daily doses of VIREAD 300 mg (tablet) or 8 mg/kg of body weight (powder) up to a maximum dose of 300 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of VIREAD 300 mg. Table 13 Mean (± SD) Tenofovir Pharmacokinetic Parameters by Age Groups for HIV-1 infected Pediatric Patients 2 years and older for the Tablet and Oral Powder Dose and Formulation 300 mg Tablet 8 mg/kg Oral Powder 12 Years to &amp;lt;18 Years (N=8) 2 Years to &amp;lt;12 Years (N=23) C max (µg/mL) 0.38 ± 0.13 0.24 ± 0.13 AUC tau (µg ∙ hr/mL) 3.39 ± 1.22 2.59 ± 1.06 Tenofovir exposures in HBV-infected pediatric subjects (12 years to less than 18 years of age) receiving oral once-daily doses of VIREAD 300 mg tablet and pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 12 years of age receiving VIREAD 8 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or powder) up to a maximum dose of 300 mg were comparable to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected adult subjects receiving identical doses. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic trials have not been performed in the elderly (65 years and older). Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir are altered in subjects with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In subjects with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, C max , and AUC 0–∞ of tenofovir were increased (Table 14). Table 14 Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean ± SD) of Tenofovir 300 mg, single dose of VIREAD in Subjects with Varying Degrees of Renal Function Baseline Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) &amp;gt;80 N=3 50–80 N=10 30–49 N=8 12–29 N=11 C max (µg/mL) 0.34 ± 0.03 0.33 ± 0.06 0.37 ± 0.16 0.60 ± 0.19 AUC 0–∞ (µg ∙ hr/mL) 2.18 ± 0.26 3.06 ± 0.93 6.01 ± 2.50 15.98 ± 7.22 CL/F (mL/min) 1043.7 ± 115.4 807.7 ± 279.2 444.4 ± 209.8 177.0 ± 97.1 CL renal (mL/min) 243.5 ± 33.3 168.6 ± 27.5 100.6 ± 27.5 43.0 ± 31.2 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 300 mg single dose of VIREAD have been studied in non-HIV infected subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. There were no substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects. No change in VIREAD dosing is required in patients with hepatic impairment. Assessment of Drug Interactions At concentrations substantially higher (~300-fold) than those observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the following human CYP isoforms: CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1. However, a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of CYP1A substrate was observed. Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. VIREAD has been evaluated in healthy volunteers in combination with other antiretroviral and potential concomitant drugs. Tables 15 and 16 summarize pharmacokinetic effects of coadministered drug on tenofovir pharmacokinetics and effects of VIREAD on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drug. TDF is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. When TDF is coadministered with an inhibitor of these transporters, an increase in absorption may be observed. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between VIREAD and efavirenz, methadone, nelfinavir, oral contraceptives, ribavirin, or sofosbuvir.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), an obligate chain terminator. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HBV RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. Activity against HIV Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC 50 (50% effective concentration) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 µM to 8.5 µM. In drug combination studies, tenofovir was not antagonistic with HIV-1 NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC 50 values ranged from 0.5 µM to 2.2 µM) and strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC 50 values ranged from 1.6 µM to 5.5 µM). Resistance HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in RT and showed a 2- to 4-fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. In Trial 903 of treatment-naïve subjects (VIREAD+3TC+EFV versus d4T+3TC+EFV) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , genotypic analyses of isolates from subjects with virologic failure through Week 144 showed development of EFV and 3TC resistance-associated substitutions to occur most frequently and with no difference between the treatment arms. The K65R substitution occurred in 8/47 (17%) of analyzed patient isolates in the VIREAD arm and in 2/49 (4%) of analyzed patient isolates in the d4T arm. Of the 8 subjects whose virus developed K65R in the VIREAD arm through 144 weeks, 7 occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96. One patient in the VIREAD arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus. Other substitutions resulting in resistance to VIREAD were not identified in this trial. In Trial 934 of treatment-naïve subjects (VIREAD+FTC+EFV versus AZT/3TC+EFV) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , genotypic analysis performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with &amp;gt;400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation showed development of EFV resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms. The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to FTC and 3TC, was observed in 2/19 of analyzed subject isolates in the VIREAD+FTC group and in 10/29 of analyzed subject isolates in the AZT/3TC group. Through 144 weeks of Trial 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis. Cross Resistance Cross resistance among certain HIV-1 NRTIs has been recognized. The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to FTC and 3TC. Therefore, cross resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three AZT-associated RT substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N), showed a 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. In Trials 902 and 907 conducted in treatment-experienced subjects (VIREAD + Standard Background Therapy (SBT) compared to placebo + SBT) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , 14/304 (5%) of the VIREAD-treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 had &amp;gt;1.4-fold (median 2.7-fold) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genotypic analysis of the baseline and failure isolates showed the development of the K65R substitution in the HIV-1 RT gene. The virologic response to VIREAD therapy has been evaluated with respect to baseline viral genotype (N=222) in treatment-experienced subjects participating in Trials 902 and 907. In these clinical trials, 94% of the participants evaluated had baseline HIV-1 isolates expressing at least one NRTI substitution. Virologic responses for subjects in the genotype substudy were similar to the overall trial results. Several exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of specific substitutions and substitutional patterns on virologic outcome. Because of the large number of potential comparisons, statistical testing was not conducted. Varying degrees of cross resistance of VIREAD to pre-existing AZT resistance-associated substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) were observed and appeared to depend on the type and number of specific substitutions. VIREAD-treated subjects whose HIV-1 expressed 3 or more AZT resistance-associated substitutions that included either the M41L or L210W RT substitution showed reduced responses to VIREAD therapy; however, these responses were still improved compared with placebo. The presence of the D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N substitution did not appear to affect responses to VIREAD therapy. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without AZT resistance-associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to VIREAD. Limited data are available for subjects whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had a reduced response. In the protocol defined analyses, virologic response to VIREAD was not reduced in subjects with HIV-1 that expressed the abacavir/FTC/3TC resistance-associated M184V substitution. HIV-1 RNA responses among these subjects were durable through Week 48. Trials 902 and 907 Phenotypic Analyses Phenotypic analysis of baseline HIV-1 from treatment-experienced subjects (N=100) demonstrated a correlation between baseline susceptibility to VIREAD and response to VIREAD therapy. Table 17 summarizes the HIV-1 RNA response by baseline VIREAD susceptibility. Table 17 HIV-1 RNA Response at Week 24 by Baseline VIREAD Susceptibility (Intent-To-Treat) Tenofovir susceptibility was determined by recombinant phenotypic Antivirogram assay (Virco). Baseline VIREAD Susceptibility Fold change in susceptibility from wild-type. Change in HIV-1 RNA Average HIV-1 RNA change from baseline through Week 24 (DAVG 24 ) in log 10 copies/mL.

The EC 50 values for tenofovir ranged from 0.14 to 1.5 µM, with CC 50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values &amp;gt;100 µM. In cell culture combination antiviral activity studies of tenofovir with HBV NrtIs entecavir, lamivudine, and telbivudine, and with the HIV-1 NRTI emtricitabine, no antagonistic activity was observed. Resistance Cumulative VIREAD genotypic resistance has been evaluated annually for up to 384 weeks in Trials 0102, 0103, 0106, 0108, and 0121 [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] with the paired HBV rt amino acid sequences of the pretreatment and on-treatment isolates from subjects who received at least 24 weeks of VIREAD monotherapy and remained viremic with HBV DNA ≥400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at the end of each study year (or at discontinuation of VIREAD monotherapy) using an as-treated analysis. In the nucleotide-naïve population from Trials 0102 and 0103, HBeAg-positive subjects had a higher baseline viral load than HBeAg-negative subjects and a significantly higher proportion of the subjects remained viremic at their last time point on VIREAD monotherapy (15% versus 5%, respectively). HBV isolates from these subjects who remained viremic showed treatment-emergent substitutions (Table 18); however, no specific substitutions occurred at a sufficient frequency to be associated with resistance to VIREAD (genotypic and phenotypic analyses). Table 18 Amino Acid Substitutions in Viremic Subjects across HBV Trials of VIREAD Compensated Liver Disease Nucleotide-Naïve (N=417) Nucleotide-naïve subjects from Trials 0102 (N=246) and 0103 (N=171) receiving up to 384 weeks of treatment with VIREAD.

In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204I/V substitutions associated with resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and telbivudine showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild type virus. The rtL180M and rtM204I/V double substitutions conferred 3.4-fold reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. HBV strains expressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V, and rtM250V substitutions associated with resistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild type virus. HBV strains expressing the adefovir resistance-associated substitutions rtA181V and/or rtN236T showed reductions in susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild type virus. Strains containing the rtA181T substitution showed changes in susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.9- to 1.5-fold that of wild type virus. One hundred fifty-two subjects initiating VIREAD therapy in Trials 0102, 0103, 0106, 0108, and 0121 harbored HBV with known resistance substitutions to HBV NrtIs: 14 with adefovir resistance-associated substitutions (rtA181S/T/V and/or rtN236T), 135 with 3TC resistance-associated substitutions (rtM204I/V), and 3 with both adefovir and 3TC resistance-associated substitutions. Following up to 384 weeks of VIREAD treatment, 10 of the 14 subjects with adefovir-resistant HBV, 124 of the 135 subjects with 3TC-resistant HBV, and 2 of the 3 subjects with both adefovir- and 3TC-resistant HBV achieved and maintained virologic suppression (HBV DNA &amp;lt;400 copies/mL [69 IU/mL]). Three of the 5 subjects whose virus harbored both the rtA181T/V and rtN236T substitutions remained viremic.</Section>
