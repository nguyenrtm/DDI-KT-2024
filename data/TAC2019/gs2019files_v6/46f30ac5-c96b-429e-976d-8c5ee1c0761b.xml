<Section name="DOSAGE &amp;amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
Prior to initiation of SELZENTRY, test all patients for CCR5 tropism using a highly sensitive tropism assay. ( 2.1 ) SELZENTRY tablets and oral solution are taken twice daily by mouth and may be taken with or without food. SELZENTRY must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medications. ( 2.2 ) Recommended Dosage in Adults: ( 2.3 ) Concomitant Medications Dosage of SELZENTRY When given with potent CYP3A inhibitors (with or without potent CYP3A inducers) including PIs (except tipranavir/ritonavir), delavirdine ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) 150 mg twice daily With NRTIs, tipranavir/ritonavir, nevirapine, raltegravir, and other drugs that are not potent CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) 300 mg twice daily With potent CYP3A inducers including efavirenz (without a potent CYP3A inhibitor) ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) 600 mg twice daily A more complete list of coadministered drugs is listed in Dosage and Administration . ( 2 ) Pediatric Patients Aged 2 Years and Older and Weighing at Least 10 kg: Administer twice daily. Dosage should be based on body weight (kg) and concomitant medications and should not exceed the recommended adult dose. ( 2.4 ) Patients with Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment may be necessary in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.5 ) Prior to initiation of SELZENTRY, test all patients for CCR5 tropism using a highly sensitive tropism assay. SELZENTRY is recommended for patients with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Outgrowth of pre-existing low-level CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 not detected by tropism testing at screening has been associated with virologic failure on SELZENTRY [see Microbiology ( 12.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Monitor patients for ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of SELZENTRY and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. • SELZENTRY tablets and oral solution are taken twice daily by mouth and may be taken with or without food. • SELZENTRY must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medications. • The recommended dosage of SELZENTRY differs based on concomitant medications due to drug interactions. Table 1 displays oral dosage of SELZENTRY based on different concomitant medications [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Table 1.

<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
• Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir) and delavirdine, will increase the concentration of SELZENTRY. ( 7.1 ) • Coadministration with CYP3A inducers, including efavirenz, may decrease the concentration of SELZENTRY. ( 7.1 ) • Coadministration with St. John’s wort is not recommended. ( 7.1 ) Maraviroc is metabolized by CYP3A, and is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, and may be modulated by inhibitors of OATP1B1 and MRP2. Therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc. Additional drug interaction information is available [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
• Hepatotoxicity accompanied by severe rash or systemic allergic reaction, including potentially life-threatening events, has been reported. Hepatic laboratory parameters including ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be obtained prior to starting SELZENTRY and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated. If rash or symptoms or signs of hepatitis or allergic reaction develop, hepatic laboratory parameters should be monitored and discontinuation of treatment should be considered. When administering SELZENTRY to patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or who are co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus, additional monitoring may be warranted. ( 5.1 ) • Severe and potentially life-threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking SELZENTRY. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue SELZENTRY and other suspected agents if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, closely. ( 5.2 ) • More cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, were observed in treatment-experienced subjects who received SELZENTRY. Additional monitoring may be warranted. ( 5.3 ) • If patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD receiving SELZENTRY (without concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors) experience postural hypotension, the dose of SELZENTRY should be reduced from 300 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily. ( 5.3 ) Hepatotoxicity with allergic features including life-threatening events has been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing. Severe rash or evidence of systemic allergic reaction including drug-related rash with fever, eosinophilia, elevated IgE, or other systemic symptoms have been reported in conjunction with hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . These events occurred approximately 1 month after starting treatment. Among reported cases of hepatitis, some were observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre-existing hepatic disease. Appropriate laboratory testing including ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with SELZENTRY and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated. Hepatic laboratory parameters should be obtained in any patient who develops rash, or signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or allergic reaction. Discontinuation of SELZENTRY should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms. When administering SELZENTRY to patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or who are co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus, additional monitoring may be warranted. The safety and efficacy of SELZENTRY have not been specifically studied in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Severe, potentially life-threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking SELZENTRY, in most cases concomitantly with other drugs associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 )] . The cases were characterized by features including rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue SELZENTRY and other suspected agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, malaise, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, lip swelling, eosinophilia). Delay in stopping treatment with SELZENTRY or other suspect drugs after the onset of rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Eleven subjects (1.3%) who received SELZENTRY had cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, during the Phase 3 trials in treatment-experienced subjects (total exposure 609 patient-years [300 on SELZENTRY once daily + 309 on SELZENTRY twice daily]), while no subjects who received placebo had such events (total exposure 111 patient-years). These subjects generally had cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors prior to use of SELZENTRY, and the relative contribution of SELZENTRY to these events is not known. In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, 3 subjects (0.8%) who received SELZENTRY had events related to ischemic heart disease and 5 subjects (1.4%) who received efavirenz had such events (total exposure 506 and 508 patient-years for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively). When SELZENTRY was administered to healthy volunteers at doses higher than the recommended dose, symptomatic postural hypotension was seen at a greater frequency than in placebo. However, when SELZENTRY was given at the recommended dose in HIV-1-infected adult subjects in Phase 3 trials, postural hypotension was seen at a rate similar to placebo (approximately 0.5%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors for postural hypotension, or receiving concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure, could be at increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events triggered by postural hypotension. Additional monitoring may be warranted. Postural Hypotension in Patients with Renal Impairment An increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency or in those with ESRD due to increased maraviroc exposure in some patients. SELZENTRY should be used in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD only if they are not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer. However, the use of SELZENTRY in these patients should only be considered when no alternative treatment options are available. If adult patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking 300 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including SELZENTRY. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection with Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], tuberculosis, or reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster ), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. SELZENTRY antagonizes the CCR5 co-receptor located on some immune cells, and therefore could potentially increase the risk of developing infections. The overall incidence and severity of infection, as well as AIDS-defining category C infections, were comparable in the treatment groups during the Phase 3 adult treatment-experienced trials of SELZENTRY. While there was a higher rate of certain upper respiratory tract infections reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY compared with placebo (23% versus 13%), there was a lower rate of pneumonia (2% versus 5%) reported in subjects receiving SELZENTRY. A higher incidence of Herpes virus infections (11 per 100 patient-years) was also reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY when adjusted for exposure compared with placebo (8 per 100 patient-years). In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, the incidence of AIDS-defining Category C events when adjusted for exposure was 1.8 for SELZENTRY compared with 2.4 for efavirenz per 100 patient-years of exposure. Patients should be monitored closely for evidence of infections while receiving SELZENTRY. While no increase in malignancy has been observed with SELZENTRY, due to this drug’s mechanism of action, it could affect immune surveillance and lead to an increased risk of malignancy. The exposure-adjusted rate for malignancies per 100 patient-years of exposure in adult treatment-experienced trials was 4.6 for SELZENTRY compared with 9.3 on placebo. In treatment-naive adult subjects, the rates were 1.0 and 2.4 per 100 patient-years of exposure for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively. Long-term follow-up is needed to more fully assess this risk.</Section>

Maraviroc is an HIV-1 antiviral drug [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . Exposure-Response Relationship in Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects The relationship between maraviroc, modeled plasma trough concentration (C min ) (1 to 9 samples per subject taken on up to 7 visits), and virologic response was evaluated in 973 treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects with varied optimized background antiretroviral regimens in Trials A4001027 and A4001028. The C min , baseline viral load, baseline CD4 + cell count, and overall sensitivity score (OSS) were found to be important predictors of virologic success (defined as viral load less than 400 copies per mL at 24 weeks). Table 9 illustrates the proportions of subjects with virologic success (%) within each C min quartile for 150-mg twice-daily and 300-mg twice-daily groups. Table 9.

Table 10 illustrates the proportion (%) of subjects with virologic success less than 50 copies per mL at 48 weeks within each C min quartile for the 300-mg twice-daily dose. Table 10.

Effects on Electrocardiogram A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female volunteers was conducted with 3 single oral doses of maraviroc and moxifloxacin. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum (upper 1-sided 95% CI) increases in QTc from baseline after 100, 300, and 900 mg of maraviroc were –2 (0), -1 (1), and 1 (3) msec, respectively, and 13 (15) msec for moxifloxacin 400 mg. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of greater than or equal to 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. Table 11. Mean Maraviroc Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults a The estimated exposure is lower compared with other trials possibly due to sparse sampling, food effect, compliance, and concomitant medications. Patient Population Maraviroc Dose n AUC 12 (ng.h/mL) C max (ng/mL) C min (ng/mL) Healthy volunteers (Phase 1) 300 mg twice daily 64 2,908 888 43.1 Asymptomatic HIV subjects (Phase 2a) 300 mg twice daily 8 2,550 618 33.6 Treatment-experienced HIV subjects (Phase 3) a 300 mg twice daily 94 1,513 266 37.2 150 mg twice daily (+ CYP3A inhibitor) 375 2,463 332 101 Treatment-naive HIV subjects (Phase 2b/3) a 300 mg twice daily 344 1,865 287 60 Absorption Peak maraviroc plasma concentrations are attained 0.5 to 4 hours following single oral doses of 1 to 1,200 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of oral maraviroc are not dose proportional over the dose range. The absolute bioavailability of a 100‑mg dose is 23% and is predicted to be 33% at 300 mg. Maraviroc is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption: Coadministration of a 300‑mg tablet with a high‑fat breakfast reduced maraviroc C max and AUC by 33% and coadministration of 75 mg of oral solution with a high-fat breakfast reduced maraviroc AUC by 73% in healthy adult volunteers. Studies with the tablet formulation demonstrated a reduced food effect at higher doses. There were no food restrictions in the adult trials (using the tablet formulation) or in the pediatric trial (using both tablet and oral solution formulations) that demonstrated the efficacy/antiviral activity and safety of maraviroc [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )]. Distribution Maraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate affinity for albumin and alpha‑1 acid glycoprotein. The volume of distribution of maraviroc is approximately 194 L. Elimination Metabolism: Trials in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and expressed enzymes have demonstrated that maraviroc is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to metabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV‑1. In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A is the major enzyme responsible for maraviroc metabolism. In vitro studies also indicate that polymorphic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 do not contribute significantly to the metabolism of maraviroc. Maraviroc is the major circulating component (~42% drug‑related radioactivity) following a single oral dose of 300 mg [ 14 C]-maraviroc. The most significant circulating metabolite in humans is a secondary amine (~22% radioactivity) formed by N‑dealkylation. This polar metabolite has no significant pharmacological activity. Other metabolites are products of mono‑oxidation and are only minor components of plasma drug‑related radioactivity. Excretion: The terminal half‑life of maraviroc following oral dosing to steady state in healthy subjects was 14 to 18 hours. A mass balance/excretion trial was conducted using a single 300‑mg dose of 14 C-labeled maraviroc. Approximately 20% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 76% was recovered in the feces over 168 hours. Maraviroc was the major component present in urine (mean of 8% dose) and feces (mean of 25% dose). The remainder was excreted as metabolites. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Maraviroc is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300‑mg dose of SELZENTRY in subjects with mild (Child‑Pugh Class A, n = 8) and moderate (Child‑Pugh Class B, n = 8) hepatic impairment with pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects (n = 8). The mean C max and AUC were 11% and 25% higher, respectively, for subjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 32% and 46% higher, respectively, for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes do not warrant a dose adjustment. Maraviroc concentrations are higher when SELZENTRY 150 mg is administered with a potent CYP3A inhibitor compared with following administration of 300 mg without a CYP3A inhibitor, so patients with moderate hepatic impairment who receive SELZENTRY 150 mg with a potent CYP3A inhibitor should be monitored closely for maraviroc‑associated adverse events. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc have not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment: A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300‑mg dose of SELZENTRY in adult subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per minute, n = 6) and ESRD (n = 6) with healthy volunteers (n = 6). Geometric mean ratios for maraviroc C max and AUC inf were 2.4‑fold and 3.2‑fold higher, respectively, for subjects with severe renal impairment, and 1.7‑fold and 2.0‑fold higher, respectively, for subjects with ESRD as compared with subjects with normal renal function in this trial. Hemodialysis had a minimal effect on maraviroc clearance and exposure in subjects with ESRD. Exposures observed in subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD were within the range observed in previous 300‑mg single‑dose trials of SELZENTRY in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. However, maraviroc exposures in the subjects with normal renal function in this trial were 50% lower than those observed in previous trials. Based on the results of this trial, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment receiving SELZENTRY without a potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer. However, if patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking SELZENTRY 300 mg twice daily, their dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . In addition, the trial compared the pharmacokinetics of multiple‑dose SELZENTRY in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir 1,000/100 mg twice daily (a potent CYP3A inhibitor combination) for 7 days in subjects with mild renal impairment (CrCl greater than 50 and less than or equal to 80 mL per minute, n = 6) and moderate renal impairment (CrCl greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 50 mL per minute, n = 6) with healthy volunteers with normal renal function (n = 6). Subjects received 150 mg of SELZENTRY at different dose frequencies (healthy volunteers – every 12 hours; mild renal impairment – every 24 hours; moderate renal impairment – every 48 hours). Compared with healthy volunteers (dosed every 12 hours), geometric mean ratios for maraviroc AUC tau , C max , and C min were 50% higher, 20% higher, and 43% lower, respectively, for subjects with mild renal impairment (dosed every 24 hours). Geometric mean ratios for maraviroc AUC tau , C max , and C min were 16% higher, 29% lower, and 85% lower, respectively, for subjects with moderate renal impairment (dosed every 48 hours) compared with healthy volunteers (dosed every 12 hours). Based on the data from this trial, no adjustment in dose is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc were evaluated in CCR5-tropic, HIV-1–infected, treatment-experienced pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years. In the dose-finding stage of Trial A4001031, doses were administered with food on intensive PK evaluation days and optimized to achieve an average concentration over the dosing interval (C avg ) of greater than 100 ng per mL. Throughout the trial, on non-intensive PK evaluation days maraviroc was taken with or without food. The initial dose of maraviroc was based on BSA and concomitant medication category (i.e., presence of CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers). The conversion of dosing to a weight (kg)-band basis in children provides comparable exposures with those observed in the trial at the corresponding BSA. Maraviroc pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric subjects receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors with or without a potent CYP3A inducer ( Table 12 ) and in subjects weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg and receiving noninteracting concomitant medications ( Table 13 ) were similar to those observed in adults. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data are available to make a comparison between adults and pediatric subjects weighing less than 30 kg and receiving noninteracting concomitant medications or between adult and pediatric subjects receiving concomitant medications consisting of a potent CYP3A inducer without CYP3A inhibitor. Table 12. Maraviroc Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Treatment-Experienced Pediatric Patients Receiving SELZENTRY with Potent CYP3A Inhibitors (with or without a Potent CYP3A Inducer) a The covariate distribution of the study population of 85 subjects on CYP3A-inhibitor-containing regimens was randomly sampled with replacement to obtain 1,000 subjects. Shown in the table are model-predicted steady-state PK parameters for the 1,000 subjects in the simulation dataset.

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on maraviroc exposure in subjects up to age 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Race and Gender: Based on population pharmacokinetics and 2 clinical CYP3A5 genotype analyses for race, no dosage adjustment is recommended based on race or gender. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc: Maraviroc is a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp and hence its pharmacokinetics are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes/transporters. The CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors ketoconazole, boceprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, saquinavir/ritonavir, and atazanavir ± ritonavir all increased the C max and AUC of maraviroc ( Table 14 ). The CYP3A and/or P-gp inducers rifampin, etravirine, and efavirenz decreased the C max and AUC of maraviroc ( Table 14 ). While not studied, potent CYP3A and/or P-gp inducers carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are expected to decrease maraviroc concentrations. Based on in vitro study results, maraviroc is also a substrate of OATP1B1 and MRP2; its pharmacokinetics may be modulated by inhibitors of these transporters. Tipranavir/ritonavir (net CYP3A inhibitor/P-gp inducer) did not affect the steady‑state pharmacokinetics of maraviroc ( Table 14 ). Cotrimoxazole and tenofovir did not affect the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc. Table 14. Effect of Coadministered Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc a Compared with historical data.

Maraviroc does not induce CYP1A2 in vitro. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that maraviroc is not a substrate for, and does not inhibit, any of the major renal uptake inhibitors (organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, organic cation transporter [OCT]2, novel organic cation transporter [OCTN]1, and OCTN2) at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro results suggest that maraviroc could inhibit P-gp in the gut. However, maraviroc did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo, indicating maraviroc may not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp clinically. Drug interaction trials were performed with maraviroc and other drugs likely to be coadministered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions ( Table 14 ). Coadministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and maraviroc 300 mg twice daily decreased the C min and AUC of amprenavir by 36% and 35%, respectively. Coadministration of fosamprenavir 1,400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily and maraviroc 300 mg once daily decreased the C min and AUC by 15% and 30%, respectively. No dosage adjustment is necessary when SELZENTRY is dosed 150 mg twice daily in combination with fosamprenavir/ritonavir dosed once or twice daily. Fosamprenavir should be given with ritonavir when coadministered with SELZENTRY. Maraviroc had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, boceprevir, zidovudine, or lamivudine. Maraviroc decreased the C min and AUC of raltegravir by 27% and 37%, respectively, which is not clinically significant. Maraviroc had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, no effect on the urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggesting no induction of CYP3A in vivo. Maraviroc had no effect on the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) at 300 mg twice daily or less in vivo and did not cause inhibition of CYP2D6 in vitro until concentrations greater than 100 microM. However, there was 234% increase in debrisoquine MR on treatment compared with baseline at 600 mg once daily, suggesting potential inhibition of CYP2D6 at higher doses. Mechanism of Action Maraviroc is a member of a therapeutic class called CCR5 co-receptor antagonists. Maraviroc selectively binds to the human chemokine receptor CCR5 present on the cell membrane, preventing the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 and CCR5 necessary for CCR5-tropic HIV-1 to enter cells. CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 entry is not inhibited by maraviroc. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Maraviroc inhibits the replication of CCR5-tropic laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in models of acute peripheral blood leukocyte infection. The mean EC 50 value (50% effective concentration) for maraviroc against HIV-1 group M isolates (subtypes A to J and circulating recombinant form AE) and group O isolates ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 nM (0.05 to 2.3 ng per mL) in cell culture. When used with other antiretroviral agents in cell culture, the combination of maraviroc was not antagonistic with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs: delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), or protease inhibitors (PIs: amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir). Maraviroc was not antagonistic with the HIV-1 gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Maraviroc was not active against CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic viruses (EC 50 value greater than 10 microM). The antiviral activity of maraviroc against HIV-2 has not been evaluated. Resistance in Cell Culture: HIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc have been selected in cell culture following serial passage of 2 CCR5-tropic viruses (CCl/85 and RU570). The maraviroc-resistant viruses remained CCR5-tropic with no evidence of a change from a CCR5-tropic virus to a CXCR4-using virus. Two amino acid residue substitutions in the V3-loop region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp160), A316T, and I323V (HXB2 numbering), were shown to be necessary for the maraviroc-resistant phenotype in the HIV-1 isolate CCl/85. In the RU570 isolate a 3-amino acid residue deletion in the V3 loop, ΔQAI (HXB2 positions 315 to 317), was associated with maraviroc resistance. The relevance of the specific gp120 substitutions observed in maraviroc-resistant isolates selected in cell culture to clinical maraviroc resistance is not known. Maraviroc-resistant viruses were characterized phenotypically by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition in phenotypic drug assays, rather than increases in EC 50 values. Cross-Resistance in Cell Culture: Maraviroc had antiviral activity against HIV‑1 clinical isolates resistant to NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs, and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide in cell culture (EC 50 values ranged from 0.7 to 8.9 nM [0.36 to 4.57 ng per mL]). Maraviroc‑resistant viruses that emerged in cell culture remained susceptible to enfuvirtide and the protease inhibitor saquinavir. Clinical Resistance: Virologic failure on maraviroc can result from genotypic and phenotypic resistance to maraviroc, through outgrowth of undetected CXCR4-using virus present before maraviroc treatment (see Tropism below), through resistance to background therapy drugs (Table 15), or due to low exposure to maraviroc [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): Week 48 data from treatment-experienced subjects failing maraviroc-containing regimens with CCR5-tropic virus (n = 58) have identified 22 viruses that had decreased susceptibility to maraviroc characterized in phenotypic drug assays by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition. Additionally, CCR5-tropic virus from 2 of these treatment-failure subjects had greater than or equal to 3-fold shifts in EC 50 values for maraviroc at the time of failure. Fifteen of these viruses were sequenced in the gp120 encoding region and multiple amino acid substitutions with unique patterns in the heterogeneous V3 loop region were detected. Changes at either amino acid position 308 or 323 (HXB2 numbering) were seen in the V3 loop in 7 of the subjects with decreased maraviroc susceptibility. Substitutions outside the V3 loop of gp120 may also contribute to reduced susceptibility to maraviroc. Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adult Subjects (Trial A4001026): Treatment-naive subjects receiving SELZENTRY had more virologic failures and more treatment-emergent resistance to the background regimen drugs compared with those receiving efavirenz ( Table 15 ). Table 15. Development of Resistance to Maraviroc or Efavirenz and Background Drugs in Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Trial A4001026 for Patients with Only CCR5-Tropic Virus at Screening Using Enhanced Sensitivity TROFILE Assay a Includes subjects failing with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropism because these viruses are not intrinsically susceptible to maraviroc. Maraviroc Efavirenz Total N in dataset (as-treated) 273 241 Total virologic failures (as-treated) 85 (31%) 56 (23%) Evaluable virologic failures with post baseline genotypic and phenotypic data 73 43 Lamivudine resistance 39 (53%) 13 (30%) Zidovudine resistance 2 (3%) 0 Efavirenz resistance – 23 (53%) Phenotypic resistance to maraviroc a 19 (26%) – In an as-treated analysis of treatment-naive subjects at 96 weeks, 32 subjects failed a maraviroc-containing regimen with CCR5-tropic virus and had a tropism result at failure; 7 of these subjects had evidence of maraviroc phenotypic resistance defined as concentration-response curves that did not reach 95% inhibition. One additional subject had a greater than or equal to 3-fold shift in the EC 50 value for maraviroc at the time of failure. A clonal analysis of the V3 loop amino acid envelope sequences was performed from 6 of the 7 subjects. Changes in V3 loop amino acid sequence differed between each of these different subjects, even for those infected with the same virus clade, suggesting that there are multiple diverse pathways to maraviroc resistance. The subjects who failed with CCR5-tropic virus and without a detectable maraviroc shift in susceptibility were not evaluated for genotypic resistance. Of the 32 maraviroc virologic failures failing with CCR5-tropic virus, 20 (63%) also had genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to background drugs in the regimen (lamivudine, zidovudine). Tropism: In both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive subjects, detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virologic response to maraviroc. Antiretroviral Treatment‑Experienced Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): In the majority of cases, treatment failure on maraviroc was associated with detection of CXCR4-using virus (i.e., CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic) which was not detected by the tropism assay prior to treatment. CXCR4-using virus was detected at failure in approximately 55% of subjects who failed treatment on maraviroc by Week 48, as compared with 9% of subjects who experienced treatment failure in the placebo arm. To investigate the likely origin of the on-treatment CXCR4-using virus, a detailed clonal analysis was conducted on virus from 20 representative subjects (16 subjects from the maraviroc arms and 4 subjects from the placebo arm) in whom CXCR4-using virus was detected at treatment failure. From analysis of amino acid sequence differences and phylogenetic data, it was determined that CXCR4-using virus in these subjects emerged from a low level of pre-existing CXCR4-using virus not detected by the tropism assay (which is population-based) prior to treatment rather than from a co-receptor switch from CCR5-tropic virus to CXCR4-using virus resulting from mutation in the virus. Detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virological response to maraviroc. Furthermore, subjects failing twice-daily maraviroc at Week 48 with CXCR4-using virus had a lower median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline (+41 cells per mm 3 ) than those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus (+162 cells per mm 3 ). The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the placebo arm was +7 cells per mm 3 . Antiretroviral Treatment‑Naive Subjects (Trial A4001026): In a 96-week trial of antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects, 14% (12 of 85) who had only CCR5-tropic virus at screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay (TROFILE) and failed therapy on maraviroc had CXCR4-using virus at the time of treatment failure. A detailed clonal analysis was conducted in 2 previously antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects enrolled in a Phase 2a monotherapy trial who had CXCR4-using virus detected after 10 days’ treatment with maraviroc. Consistent with the detailed clonal analysis conducted in treatment-experienced subjects, the CXCR4-using variants appear to emerge from outgrowth of a pre-existing undetected CXCR4-using virus. Screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay reduced the number of maraviroc virologic failures with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus at failure to 12 compared with 24 when screening with the original tropism assay. All but one (11 of 12; 92%) of the maraviroc failures failing with CXCR4 or dual/mixed-tropic virus also had genotypic and phenotypic resistance to the background drug lamivudine at failure and 33% (4 of 12) developed zidovudine-associated resistance substitutions. Subjects who had only CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and failed maraviroc therapy with CXCR4-using virus had a median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline of +113 cells per mm 3 while those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus had an increase of +135 cells per mm 3 . The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the efavirenz arm was +95 cells per mm 3 . Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Trial A4001031): In the Week 48 analysis of Trial A4001031 (n = 103), the mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc observed in the treatment-experienced pediatric population were similar to those observed in adult populations: reasons for virologic failure included failing with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus, evidence of reduced maraviroc susceptibility as measured by a decrease in maximal percentage inhibition (MPI), and emergence of resistance to background drug in the regimen.</Section>
