Toxic levels of digoxin are only slightly higher than therapeutic levels. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin are complex and dose determination should take into account patient-specific factors (age, lean body weight, renal function, etc.). (2.4)(2.5) Patients should be monitored for toxicity and therapeutic effect and doses should be adjusted, accordingly. (2.2)         The dose of digoxin should be based on clinical assessment but individual patient factors should be taken into consideration. Those factors are:  Lean body weight Renal function Patient age Concurrent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] Concomitant medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]   Because the pharmacokinetics of digoxin are complex, and because toxic levels of digoxin are only slightly higher than therapeutic levels, digoxin dosing can be difficult. The recommended approach is to  estimate the patient’s daily maintenance dose adjust the estimate to account for patient-specific factors choose a dosing regimen decide whether to initiate therapy with a loading dose monitor the patient for toxicity and for therapeutic effect adjust the dose  Dose titration may be accomplished by either of two general approaches that differ in dosage and frequency of administration, but reach the same total amount of digoxin accumulated in the body.   If rapid titration is considered medically appropriate, administer a loading dose based upon projected peak digoxin body stores. Maintenance dose can be calculated as a percentage of the loading dose.  More gradual titration may be obtained by beginning an appropriate maintenance dose, thus allowing digoxin body stores to accumulate slowly. Steady-state serum digoxin concentrations will be achieved in approximately five half-lives of the drug for the individual patient. Depending upon the patient’s renal function, this will take between 1 and 3 weeks.           In general, the dose of digoxin used should be determined on clinical grounds. However, measurement of serum digoxin concentrations can be helpful to the clinician in determining the adequacy of digoxin therapy and in assigning certain probabilities to the likelihood of digoxin intoxication.  Studies have shown diminished efficacy at serum levels &amp;lt; 0.5 ng/mL, while levels above 2 ng/mL are associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit. The inotropic effects of digoxin tend to appear at lower concentrations than the electrophysiological effects. Based on retrospective analysis, adverse events may be higher in the upper therapeutic range. Perform sampling of serum concentrations just before the next scheduled dose of the drug. If this is not possible, sample at least 6 hours or later after the last dose, regardless of the route of administration or the formulation used. On a once-daily dosing schedule, the concentration of digoxin will be 10% to 25% lower when sampled at 24 versus 8 hours, depending upon the patient’s renal function. On a twice-daily dosing schedule, there will be only minor differences in serum digoxin concentrations whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose. The serum concentration of digoxin should always be interpreted in the overall clinical context, and an isolated measurement should not be used alone as the basis for increasing or decreasing the dose of the drug. When decision-making is to be guided by serum digoxin levels, the clinician must consider the possibility of reported concentrations that have been falsely elevated by endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)]  .  If the assay being used is sensitive to these substances, it may be prudent to obtain a baseline measurement before digoxin therapy is started, and correct later values by the reported baseline level.          Loading doses for each age group are given in Table 1 below.  In pediatric patients, if a loading dose is needed, it can be administered with roughly half the total given as the first dose. Additional fractions of this planned total dose may be given at 4- to 8-hour intervals, with careful assessment of clinical response before each additional dose. If the patient’s clinical response necessitates a change from the calculated loading dose of digoxin, then calculation of the maintenance dose should be based upon the amount actually given as the loading dose  [see Table 1 and 2].   Table 1: Estimate the Loading Dose       Age   Oral Loading Dose, mcg/kg    Premature 20 - 30   Full-Term 25 - 35   1 to 24 months  35 - 60   2 to 5 years  30 - 45   5 to 10 years 20 - 35   Over 10 years  10 - 15     More gradual attainment of digoxin levels can also be accomplished by beginning an appropriate maintenance dose. The range of percentages provided in Table 2 (2.4 Estimate of Daily Maintenance Dose) can be used in calculating this dose for patients with normal renal function. Steady state will be attained after approximately 5 days in subjects with normal renal function.          The recommended daily maintenance doses for each age group are given in Table 2 below. These recommendations assume the presence of normal renal function.  Table 2: Estimate of the Daily Maintenance Dose       Age   Daily Oral Maintenance Dose, mcg/kg/day   Dose Regimen, mcg/kg/dose    Premature 4.7 – 7.8 2.3 – 3.9 Twice daily   Full-Term 7.5 – 11.3 3.8 – 5.6 Twice daily   1 to 24 months  11.3 – 18.8 5.6 – 9.4 Twice daily   2 to 5 years 9.4 – 13.1 4.7 – 6.6 Twice daily   5 to 10 years 5.6 – 11.3 2.8 – 5.6 Twice daily   Over 10 years 3.0 – 4.5 3.0 – 4.5 Once daily     Dosage guidelines provided are based upon average patient response and substantial individual variation can be expected. Accordingly, dosage selection must be based upon clinical assessment and ultimately therapeutic drug level monitoring of the patient. Divided daily dosing is recommended for pediatric patients under age 10. In the newborn period, renal clearance of digoxin is diminished and suitable dosage adjustments must be made as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Renal clearance is further reduced in the premature infant. Beyond the immediate newborn period, pediatric patients generally require proportionally larger doses than adults on the basis of body weight or body surface area. Pediatric patients over 10 years of age require adult dosages in proportion to their body weight. Some researchers have suggested that infants and young pediatric patients tolerate slightly higher serum concentrations than do adults. For pediatric patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction, lower starting doses should be considered combined with frequent monitoring of digoxin levels.  NOTE: The calibrated dropper supplied with the 60 mL bottle of digoxin oral solution is not appropriate to measure doses below 0.2 mL. Doses less than 0.2 mL require appropriate methods or measuring devices designed to administer an accurate amount to the patient, such as a graduated syringe.          The body’s handling of digoxin can be affected by many different patient-specific factors. Some of the possible effects are small, so anticipatory dose adjustment might not be required, but others should be considered before initial dosing [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and  Drug Interactions (7)] . Both adults and pediatric patients with abnormal renal function need to have the dose of digoxin proportionally reduced. Recommended maintenance doses based upon lean body weight and renal function are listed in Table 3. Developmental changes in pediatric renal function were factored into Table 3. However, age-related and other changes in adult renal function were not.  The volume of distribution of digoxin is proportional to lean body weight and doses listed in Table 3 assume average body composition. The dose of digoxin must be reduced in patients whose lean weight is an abnormally small fraction of their total body mass because of obesity or edema.   Table 3: Usual Maintenance DoseThe doses are rounded to whole numbers. Twice daily dosing is recommended for pediatric patients under 10 years of age. Once daily dosing is recommended for pediatric patients above 10 years of age and adults. Requirements (mcg) of Digoxin Based upon Age, Lean Body Weight and Renal Function                      Corrected Ccr  (mL/min per 70 kg)Ccr is creatinine clearance, corrected to 70 kg body weight or 1.73 m2 body surface area. For adults, if only serum creatinine concentrations (Scr) are available, a Ccr (corrected to 70 kg body weight) may be estimated in men as (140 – Age)/Scr. For women, this result should be multiplied by 0.85. Note: This equation cannot be used for estimating creatinine clearance in infants or pediatric patients. For pediatric patients, the modified Schwartz equation may be used as listed below. The formula was based on height in cm and Scr in mg/dL where k is a constant. Ccr is corrected to 1.73 m2 body surface area. During the first year of life, the value of k is 0.33 for pre-term babies and 0.45 for term infants. The k is 0.55 for pediatric patients and adolescent girls and 0.7 for adolescent boys. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = (k x Height)/Scr.     Dose to be given Twice Daily   Dose to be given Once Daily    Number of Days Before Steady State Achieve       &amp;lt; 10 years of age   &amp;gt; 10 years of age and adults     Lean Body Weight Lean Body Weight    kg   5   10   20   30   40   50   60   40   50   60   70   80   90   100    lb 11 22 44 66 88 110 132 88 110 132 154 176 198 220   10  10 20 40 60 80 100 120 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 19   20  11 23 45 68 90 113 135 90 113 135 158 180 203 225 16   30  13 25 50 75 100 125 150 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 14   40  14 28 55 83 110 138 165 110 138 165 193 220 248 275 13   50  15 30 60 90 120 150 180 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 12   60  16 33 65 98 130 163 195 130 163 195 228 260 293 325 11   70  18 35 70 105 140 175 210 140 175 210 245 280 315 350 10   80  19 38 75 113 150 188 225 150 188 225 263 300 338 375 9   90  20 40 80 120 160 200 240 160 200 240 280 320 360 400 8   100  21 43 85 128 170 213 255 170 213 255 298 340 383 425 7    Determination of the target dose in milliliters of Digoxin Oral Solution based on body weight is shown in Table 4.

PGP Inducers/Inhibitors: Drugs that induce or inhibit PGP have the potential to alter digoxin pharmacokinetics. (7.1) There are numerous drug interactions associated with digoxin. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during drug therapy. See full prescribing information for a complete listing of pharmacokinetic (7.2) (12.3) and pharmacodynamic interactions (7.3).          Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, at the level of intestinal absorption, renal tubular section and biliary-intestinal secretion. Therefore, drugs that induce/inhibit P-glycoprotein have the potential to alter digoxin pharmacokinetics.

No additional actions are required.    NA – Not available/reported                 Antiarrhythmics  Dofetilide Concomitant administration with digoxin was associated with a higher rate of torsades de pointes.   Moricizine Reported to increase PR interval and QRS duration. There are reports of first degree atrioventricular block or bundle branch block developing with digitalis administration. The known effects of moricizine on calcium conductance may explain the effects on atrioventricular node conduction.    Sotalol Proarrhythmic events were more common in patients receiving sotalol and digoxin than on either alone; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of CHF, a known risk factor for proarrhythmia, in patients receiving digoxin.     Parathyroid Hormone Analog  Teriparatide Sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium.    Thyroid Supplement  Thyroid Treatment of hypothyroidism in patients taking digoxin may increase the dose requirements of digoxin.    Sympathomimetics  Epinepherine Can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.   Norepinephrine   Dopamine    Neuromuscular Blocking Agents  Succinylcholine May cause sudden extrusion of potassium from muscle cells causing arrhythmias in patients taking digoxin.    Supplements  Calcium If administered rapidly by intravenous route, can produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients.    Beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers   Additive effects on AV node conduction can result in complete heart block.               Endogenous substances of unknown composition (digoxin-like immunoreactive substances, DLIS) can interfere with standard radioimmunoassays for digoxin. The interference most often causes results to be falsely positive or falsely elevated, but sometimes it causes results to be falsely reduced. Some assays are more subject to these failings than others. Several LC/MS/MS methods are available that may provide less susceptibility to DLIS interference. DLIS are present in up to half of all neonates and in varying percentages of pregnant women, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and other patients who are volume-expanded for any reason. The measured levels of DLIS (as digoxin equivalents) are usually low (0.2 to 0.4 ng/mL), but sometimes they reach levels that would be considered therapeutic or even toxic. In some assays, spironolactone, canrenone and potassium canrenoate may be falsely detected as digoxin, at levels up to 0.5 ng/mL. Some traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine substances like Chan Su, Siberian Ginseng, Asian Ginseng, Ashwagandha or Dashen, can cause similar interference. Spironolactone and DLIS are much more extensively protein-bound than digoxin. As a result, assays of free digoxin levels in protein-free ultrafiltrate (which tend to be about 25% less than total levels, consistent with the usual extent of protein binding) are less affected by spironolactone or DLIS. It should be noted that ultrafiltration does not solve all interference problems with alternative medicines. The use of an LC/MS/MS method may be the better option according to the good results it provides, especially in term of specificity and limit of quantization.</Section>
<Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">
Accessory AV Pathway: Increased risk of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation. (5.1) Sinus node disease and AV block: Digoxin use can exacerbate the condition and may cause advanced or complete heart block. (5.2) Misidentification of digoxin toxicity: Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity may be mistaken for worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. (5.3) Preserved left ventricular systolic function: Patients with heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction may be more susceptible to digoxin toxicity. (5.4) Impaired renal function: Renal impairment results in increased digoxin exposure and requires dosage adjustments. (5.5) Electrolyte disorders: Toxicity is increased by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia. (5.6) Hypermetabolic states: In patients with atrial arrhythmias associated with hypermetabolic states, control of resting ventricular rate is particularly resistant to digoxin treatment. (5.8) The use of digoxin may result in potentially detrimental increases in coronary vascular resistance. (5.9) Avoid digoxin in patients with myocarditis. (5.10)          Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.          Because digoxin slows sinoatrial and AV conduction, the drug commonly prolongs the PR interval. Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. In such patients consideration should be given to the insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.           Some signs and symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and certain arrhythmias) can equally result from digoxin toxicity as from congestive heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase digoxin dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not obvious, measurement of serum digoxin levels may be helpful.           Patients with certain disorders involving heart failure associated with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction may not benefit from digoxin treatment and may be particularly susceptible to adverse reactions when they are treated with digoxin.  In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (formerly called idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), the positive inotropic effect of digoxin leads to an increased subvalvular outflow gradient and therefore, may compromise cardiac output. Digoxin is rarely beneficial in patients with this condition.  Chronic constrictive pericarditis is not generally associated with any inotropic defect, so heart failure of this etiology is unlikely to respond to treatment with digoxin. By slowing the resting heart rate, digoxin may actually decrease cardiac output in these patients.  Digoxin as an inotropic agent is of limited value in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathies, although it has been used for ventricular rate control in the subgroup of patients with atrial fibrillation. In addition, patients with amyloid heart disease may be more susceptible to toxicity from digoxin at therapeutic levels because of an increased binding of digoxin to extracellular amyloid fibrils.          Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) . Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.          In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur at concentrations within therapeutic range because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Serum potassium levels should be carefully monitored when digoxin is given to patients at high risk of hypokalemia (e.g., those receiving diuretics, corticosteroids, or other drugs that commonly lead to potassium loss; those with gastrointestinal losses through diarrhea, vomiting, or nasogastric suction; or those with potassium-losing endocrinopathies or nephropathies). Digoxin toxicity is also more likely in the presence of hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is common in most of the same conditions in which hypokalemia appears. Most notably, it is commonly seen in alcoholics and in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypercalcemia.  Because digoxin’s therapeutic and toxic effects are all largely mediated by intracellular calcium distribution, they are affected by abnormalities in serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia.          Reduction of digoxin dosage may be desirable prior to electrical cardioversion to avoid induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but the physician must consider the consequences of a rapid increase in ventricular response to atrial fibrillation if digoxin is withheld 1 to 2 days prior to cardioversion. If there is a suspicion that digitalis toxicity exists, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the energy level selected should be minimal at first and carefully increased in an attempt to avoid precipitating ventricular arrhythmias.           Hypothyrodism may reduce the requirements for digoxin. Heart failure and atrial arrhythmias resulting from hypermetabolic or hyperdynamic states (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, or arteriovenous shunt) are best treated by addressing the underlying condition. Atrial arrhythmias associated with hypermetabolic states (e.g., hyperthyroidism) are particularly resistant to digoxin treatment. Large doses of digoxin are not recommended as the only treatment of these arrhythmias and care must be taken to avoid toxicity if large doses of digoxin are required. In hypothyroidism, the digoxin requirements are reduced. Digoxin responses are normal in patients with compensated thyroid disease.          In patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly if they have ongoing ischemia, the use of inotropic drugs, such as digoxin, may result in undesirable increases in myocardial oxygen demand and ischemia. Moreover, the use of digoxin may result in potentially detrimental increases in coronary vascular resistance mediated through alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation.          Digoxin can precipitate vasoconstriction and may promote production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, avoid digoxin in patients with myocarditis.          The use of therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause prolongation of the PR interval and depression of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. Digoxin may produce false positive ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram during exercise testing that may be indistinguishable from those of ischemia. These electrophysiologic effects reflect an expected effect of the drug and are not indicative of toxicity. Digoxin does not significantly decrease heart rate during exercise.           Patients receiving digoxin should have their serum electrolytes and renal function (serum creatinine concentrations) assessed periodically; the frequency of assessments will depend on the clinical setting. Assays of serum digoxin levels are described elsewhere [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)] , as is their use in patient monitoring [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
All of digoxin’s actions are mediated through its effects on NaK–ATPase. This enzyme, the “sodium pump,” is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells. By inhibiting NaK–ATPase, digoxin  causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity; indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes; reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines; increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure; increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves; and allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.   The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), and decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).           Short- and long-term treatment with digoxin slows heart rate, increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.           Absorption  Following oral administration, peak serum concentrations of digoxin occur at 30 to 90 minutes. In pediatric patients and in adult volunteers, absolute bioavailability of digoxin from the solution formulation is 70 to 85%, similar to that seen (in adults) with standard tablets (60 to 80%). When the solution is taken after meals, the peak serum concentrations increase by 20% and the total amount of digoxin absorbed increases by 43%, but the rate of digoxin absorption is unchanged. When taken with meals high in bran fiber, however, the amount absorbed from an oral dose may be reduced. Digoxin absorption may also be affected by various concomitant therapy modulating gastric pH and P-glycoprotein [see  Drug Interactions (7)] . Comparisons of the systemic availability and equivalent doses for preparations of digoxin are shown in Table 5.  Table 5: Comparisons of the Systemic Availability and Equivalent Doses for Preparations of Digoxin          Product AbsoluteBioavailability  Equivalent Doses (mcg)For example, 125 mcg tablets equivalent to 125 mcg solution equivalent to 100 mcg capsules equivalent to 100 mcg injection/IV. Among Dosage Forms   Tablets 60-80% 62.5 125 250 500   Solution 70-85% 62.5 125 250 500   Capsules 90-100% 50 100 200 400   Injection/IV 100% 50 100 200 400    In some patients, orally administered digoxin is converted to inactive reduction products (e.g., dihydrodigoxin) by colonic bacteria in the gut. Data suggested that one in ten patients treated with digoxin will degrade 40% or more of the ingested dose. As a result, certain antibiotics may increase the absorption of digoxin in such patients. The magnitude of rise in serum digoxin concentration relates to the extent of bacterial inactivation, and may be as much as two-fold in some cases.  Distribution  Following drug administration, a 6- to 8-hour tissue distribution phase is observed. This is followed by a much more gradual decline in the serum concentration of the drug, which is dependent on the elimination of digoxin from the body. Clinical evidence indicates that the early high serum concentrations do not reflect the concentration of digoxin at its sites of action, but that with chronic use, the steady-state post-distribution serum concentrations are in equilibrium with tissue concentrations and correlate with pharmacologic effects. In individual patients, these post-distribution serum concentrations may be useful in evaluating therapeutic and toxic effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Digoxin is concentrated in tissues and therefore has a large apparent volume of distribution. Digoxin crosses both the blood-brain barrier and the placenta. At delivery, the serum digoxin concentration in the newborn is similar to the serum concentration in the mother. Approximately 25% of digoxin in the plasma is bound to protein. Serum digoxin concentrations are not significantly altered by large changes in fat tissue weight, so that its distribution space correlates with lean (i.e., ideal) body weight, not total body weight.  Metabolism  Sixteen percent of digoxin is metabolized. The end metabolites include 3-β-digoxigenin, 3-keto-digoxigenin, and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The metabolism of digoxin is not dependent on the cytochrome P-450 system, and digoxin is not known to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 system.  Excretion  Elimination of digoxin is predominantly renal, although in adult volunteers about a quarter of serum digoxin is eliminated through the intestine, excreted in bile or secreted directly into the lumen by P-glycoprotein. Elimination of digoxin follows first order kinetics. Following intravenous administration to healthy volunteers, 50% to 70% of a digoxin dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal excretion of digoxin is proportional to glomerular filtration rate. The serum half-life of digoxin in pediatric patients is reported to be 18 to 36 hours, and in adults it is typically 36 to 48 hours. The half-life in anuric patients is prolonged to 3.5 to 5 days. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis, exchange transfusion, or cardiopulmonary bypass because most of the drug is bound to tissue.   Drug-drug Interactions  Based on literature reports no significant changes in digoxin exposure were reported when digoxin was co-administered with the following drugs: alfuzosin, aliskiren, amlodipine, aprepitant, argatroban, aspirin, atorvastatin, benazepril, bisoprolol, black cohosh, bosentan, candesartan, citalopram, clopidogrel, colesevelam, dipyridamole, disopyramide, donepezil, doxazosin, dutasteride, echinacea, enalapril, eprosartan, ertapenem, escitalopram, esmolol, ezetimibe, famciclovir, felodipine, finasteride, flecainide, fluvastatin, fondaparinux, galantamine, gemifloxacin, grapefruit juice, irbesartan, isradipine, ketorolac, levetiracetam, levofloxacin, lisinopril, losartan, lovastatin, meloxicam, mexilitine, midazolam, milk thistle, moexipril, montelukast, moxifloxacin, mycophenolate, nateglinide, nesiritide, nicardipine, nisoldipine, olmesartan, orlistat, pantoprazole, paroxetine, perindopril, pioglitazone, pravastatin, prazosin, procainamide, quinapril, raloxifene, ramipril, repaglinide, rivastigmine, rofecoxib, ropinirole, rosiglitazone, rosuvastatin, sertraline, sevelamer, simvastatin, sirolimus, solifenacin, tamsulosin, tegaserod, terbinafine, tiagabine, ticlopidine, tigecycline, topiramate, torsemide, tramadol, trandolapril, triamterene, trospium, trovafloxacin, valacyclovir, valsartan, varenicline, voriconazole, zaleplon, and zolpidem.</Section>

<SentenceText>All of digoxin’s actions are mediated through its effects on NaK–ATPase.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1430" LabelDrug="Digoxin" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>This enzyme, the “sodium pump,” is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1431" LabelDrug="Digoxin" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>By inhibiting NaK–ATPase, digoxin causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity; indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes; reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines; increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure; increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves; and allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="1432" LabelDrug="Digoxin" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), and decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).</SentenceText>
