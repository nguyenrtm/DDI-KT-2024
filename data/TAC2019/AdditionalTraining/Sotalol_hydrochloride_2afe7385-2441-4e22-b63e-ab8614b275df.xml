Intravenous sotalol must be diluted. Appropriate diluents are saline, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or Ringer's lactate. Intravenous sotalol is administered by a volumetric infusion pump over 5 hours at a constant infusion rate. See full prescribing information for general rules and safety measures (2.1), dose selection (2.2) and preparation of infusion (2.3)   Maintenance of sotalol therapy – Replacement of Oral Dosing  The intravenous dose is approximately equal to the oral dose and administered at the same dosing frequency. 75 mg of intravenous sotalol is approximately equal to 80 mg of oral sotalol (2.2)  Initiation of Therapy   Calculate creatinine clearance to determine dosing interval (2.1) Starting adult dose is 75 mg administered twice daily. If creatinine clearance is between 60 and 40 mL/min, administer once daily, if less than 40 mg/mL, sotalol is not recommended (2.1) The dose can be up-titrated to maximal dose of 150 mg twice daily under close ECG and QT interval monitoring (2.5, 2.6)          For the safety of the patient, the safety measures required of oral sotalol administration must also be applied for intravenous route. To minimize the risk of induced arrhythmia, patients initiated or re-initiated on sotalol should be hospitalized for at least three days or until steady state drug levels are achieved, in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate intravenous sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy with starting sotalol injection. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval for sotalol. If the baseline QT is greater than 450 ms (JT &amp;gt;330 ms if QRS over 100 ms), sotalol is not recommended. The patient's creatinine clearance should be calculated using the one of several formulas. The Cockcroft-Gault formula to determine creatinine clearance is:       Creatinine clearance (male) =  (140-age) × body weight in kg      72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)   Creatinine clearance (female) =  (140-age) × body weight in kg ×0.85      72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)    When serum creatinine is given in µmol/L, divide the value by 88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L). Start sotalol therapy only if the baseline QT interval is &amp;lt;450 ms. During initiation and titration, monitor the QT interval after the completion of each infusion If the QT interval prolongs to 500 ms or greater, reduce the dose, decrease the infusion rate, or discontinue the drug. Administer sotalol twice daily in patients with a creatinine clearance &amp;gt;60 mL/min or once daily) in patients with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min. Sotalol is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance &amp;lt;40 mL/min. The recommended initial IV dose of sotalol is 75 mg (once or twice daily) and is initiated as shown in the dosing algorithm described below. The 75 mg dose can be titrated upward to 112.5 or 150 mg after at least 3 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].           The bioavailability of oral sotalol is between 90% and 100%. The corresponding dose of intravenous sotalol is, therefore, slightly less than that of the oral dose. The effects of the initial intravenous dose must be monitored and the dose titrated either upward or downward, if needed, based on clinical effect, QT interval, or adverse reactions.

Appropriate diluents are saline, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or Ringer's lactate. Usually, prepare in a volume of 100-250 mL. Use a volumetric infusion pump to infuse intravenous sotalol at a constant rate. The following table compensates for dead space in the infusion set.

Monitor ECG for excessive increase in QTc.          If the 75 mg dose of intravenous sotalol does not reduce the frequency of relapses of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias or symptomatic AFIB/AFL and is tolerated without excessive (i.e., to &amp;gt;500 ms) QTc prolongation, increase the dose to 112.5 mg infused over 5 hours, once or twice daily depending upon the creatinine clearance. Continue to monitor QTc during dose escalations.          The recommended initial dose of intravenous sotalol is 75 mg infused over 5 hours, once or twice daily based on creatinine clearance. The dose may be increased in increments of 75 mg/day every 3 days. The usual therapeutic effect is observed with oral doses of 80 to 160 mg once or twice a day (corresponding to 75 to 150 mg intravenous sotalol). Oral doses as high as 240-320 mg once or twice a day (corresponding to 225 to 300 mg intravenous sotalol) have been utilized in patients with refractory life-threatening arrhythmias.           In the U.S. multicenter dose-response study, 120 mg orally once or twice a day (corresponding to 112.5 mg intravenous sotalol) was found to be the most effective dose in prolonging the time to ECG-documented symptomatic recurrence of AFIB/AFL. If that dose level, at steady state, does not reduce the frequency of early relapse of arrhythmia and is tolerated without excessive QTc prolongation (&amp;gt;520 ms), increase the dose to 160 mg orally once or twice a day (corresponding to 150 mg intravenous sotalol).           Intravenous sotalol has not been studied in children. As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QTc interval and heart rate.  For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in children [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide. From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended. For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m2 three times a day (90 mg/m2 total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total oral daily dose for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m2 (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing being carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.  For children about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph which shows age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.   For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m2, administered orally three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.68) = 20 mg/m2, administered orally three times daily. For a child aged 1 week, the initial starting oral dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 × 0.3) = 9 mg/m2. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.  In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults sotalol should be used with particular caution in children if the QTc is greater than 500 ms on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTc exceeds 550 ms.  The use of oral sotalol in children with renal impairment has not been investigated. Sotalol elimination is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. Monitoring of heart rate and QTc is most important. It will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration in these children.     Figure</Section>

Digoxin increases the risk of proarrhythmic events (7.1) Calcium blocking drugs may have additive effects on decreasing atrioventricular conduction, ventricular function, and blood pressure (7.2) Concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs may produce hypotension, marked bradycardia, and syncope (7.3) Dosage of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked (7.4) Dose of beta-2 receptor agonists may have to be increased (7.5) Sotalol may potentiate the rebound hypertension after discontinuation of clonidine (7.6)          Proarrhythmic events were more common in sotalol treated patients also receiving digoxin; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of heart failure, a known risk factor for proarrhythmia, in the patients receiving digoxin.           Sotalol and calcium blocking drugs can be expected to have additive effects on atrioventricular conduction, ventricular function, and blood pressure.           Concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine and guanethidine, with a beta-blocker may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous tone. Monitor such patients for hypotension and marked bradycardia which may produce syncope.           Hyperglycemia may occur, and the dosage of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked.           Beta-agonists such as albuterol, terbutaline and isoproterenol may have to be administered in increased dosages when used concomitantly with sotalol.           Beta-blocking drugs may potentiate the rebound hypertension sometimes observed after discontinuation of clonidine.           Sotalol has not been studied with other drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with sotalol. In clinical trials, sotalol was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for &amp;gt;1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with intravenous sotalol because of their potential to prolong refractoriness [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.           No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.</Section>

QT prolongation and proarrhythmia: Reduce dose, reduce rate of infusion, or discontinue (5.1) Bradycardia, AV block, hypotension, worsening heart failure: Reduce dose as needed (5.3, 5.4, 5.5. 5.6) Acute exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy: Do not abruptly discontinue (5.8)  Electrolyte disturbances must be corrected (5.9) Monitor serum glucose in diabetic patients as sotalol may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, or worsen hyperglycemia (5.12)          Sotalol can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation is directly related to the concentration of sotalol. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance, gender (female) and larger doses increase the risk of TdP. The risk of TdP can be reduced by adjustment of the sotalol dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in QTc.  Initiate sotalol only in a facility that can provide ECG monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Steady-state plasma levels of sotalol and maximum QTc prolongation occur by 3 days. Calculation of the creatinine clearance must precede administration of the first dose of sotalol. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection [see Dosage and Administration (2)].           The use of sotalol in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with sotalol. In clinical trials, sotalol was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for &amp;gt;1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with intravenous sotalol because of their potential to prolong refractoriness. There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.           In studies of oral sotalol, the incidence of bradycardia (as determined by the investigators) in the supraventricular arrhythmia population treated with oral sotalol was 13% and led to discontinuation in 2.4%. Bradycardia itself increases the risk of Torsade de Pointes, so carefully monitor patients receiving concomitant digoxin.          In general, sotalol is not recommended in patients with sick sinus syndrome associated with symptomatic arrhythmias, because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, or sinus arrest. In patients with AFIB and sinus node dysfunction, sotalol increases the risk of Torsade de Pointes, especially after cardioversion. Sotalol augments bradycardia and QTc prolongation following cardioversion. Patients with AFIB/AFL associated with the sick sinus syndrome may be treated with sotalol if they have an implanted pacemaker for control of bradycardia symptoms.           Sotalol produces significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and may result in hypotension. Although sotalol is usually well-tolerated, monitor hemodynamics in patients with marginal cardiac compensation as deterioration in cardiac performance may occur.          Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in heart failure, and beta-blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In a pooled data base of four placebo-controlled AFIB/AFL and PSVT studies, new or worsening heart failure occurred during therapy with oral sotalol in 5 (1.2%) of 415 patients. In these studies patients with uncontrolled heart failure were excluded (i.e., NYHA Functional Classes III or IV). In other premarketing oral sotalol studies, new or worsened heart failure occurred in 3% of patients and led to discontinuation in approximately 1% of patients receiving sotalol. The incidence was higher in patients presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (5%), or a prior history of heart failure (7%). Based on a life-table analysis, the one-year incidence of new or worsened heart failure was 3% in patients without a prior history and 10% in patients with a prior history of heart failure.           Oral sotalol has been used in a controlled trial following an acute myocardial infarction without evidence of increased mortality [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Although specific studies of its use in treating atrial arrhythmias after infarction have not been conducted, the usual precautions regarding heart failure, avoidance of hypokalemia, bradycardia or prolonged QT interval apply. Experience in the use of sotalol to treat ventricular arrhythmias in the early phase of recovery from acute MI is limited. In the first 2 weeks post-MI careful dose titration is especially important, particularly in patients with markedly impaired ventricular function.          Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy. Occasional cases of exacerbation of angina pectoris, arrhythmias and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Therefore, when discontinuing chronically administered sotalol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, carefully monitor the patient and consider the temporary use of an alternative beta-blocker if appropriate. If possible, the dosage of sotalol should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks. If angina or acute coronary insufficiency develops, appropriate therapy should be instituted promptly. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized in patients receiving sotalol, abrupt discontinuation in patients with arrhythmias may unmask latent coronary insufficiency.          Sotalol should not be used in patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to correction of imbalance, as these conditions increase the potential for Torsade de Pointes. Special attention should be given to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or patients receiving concomitant diuretic drugs.           Sotalol is eliminated principally via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of sotalol [see Dosage and Administration (2)].           Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. If sotalol is to be administered, use the smallest effective dose, to minimize inhibition of bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors.           Beta-blockade may mask some important premonitory signs of acute hypoglycemia (e.g., tachycardia) n patients with diabetes (especially labile diabetes) or with a history of episodes of spontaneous hypoglycemia.           Beta-blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade which might be followed by an exacerbation of symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm. The beta-blocking effects of sotalol may be useful in controlling heart rate in AFIB associated with thyrotoxicosis, but no study has been conducted to evaluate this.           While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.           The management of patients undergoing major surgery who are being treated with beta-blockers is controversial. Protracted severe hypotension and difficulty in restoring and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm after anesthesia have been reported in patients receiving beta-blockers.           The presence of sotalol in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary metanephrine when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods.</Section>

Sotalol has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. Intravenous sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at oral doses of about 80 mg/day and maximal at oral doses between 320 and 640 mg/day. Sotalol does not have partial agonist or membrane stabilizing activity. Although significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg, significant Class III effects are seen only at daily doses of 160 mg and above.  In children, a Class III electrophysiological effect can be seen at daily doses of 210 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA). A reduction of the resting heart rate due to the beta-blocking effect of sotalol is observed at daily doses ≥90 mg/m2 in children.                 Electrophysiology: Sotalol prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte, as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle (Class III activity). In intact animals it slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue. In man, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of sotalol are manifested by increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electro-physiological effects in man include prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials, and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (where present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40-100 ms in QT and 10-40 ms in QTc. In a study of patients with atrial fibrillation /flutter (AFIB/AFL) receiving three different oral doses of sotalol given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced creatinine clearance), mean increases in QT intervals measured from 12-lead ECGs of 25 ms, 40 ms and 54 ms were found in the 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg dose groups, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] No significant alteration in QRS interval was observed.  In a small study (n=25) of patients with implanted defibrillators treated concurrently with sotalol, the average defibrillatory threshold was 6 joules (range 2-15 joules) compared to a mean of 16 joules for a non-randomized comparative group primarily receiving amiodarone. In a dose-response trial comparing three dose levels of sotalol, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg with placebo given q12h (or q24h in patients with a reduced renal creatinine clearance) for the prevention of recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AFIB)/flutter (AFL), the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB/AFL was 125, 107, 110 and 99 beats/min in the placebo, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose groups, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.017) for each sotalol dose group versus placebo). In another placebo controlled trial in which sotalol was titrated to a dose between 160 and 320 mg/day in patients with chronic AFIB, the mean ventricular rate during recurrence of AFIB was 107 and 84 beats/min in the placebo and sotalol groups, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001).  Twenty-five children in an unblinded, multicenter trial with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) tachyarrhythmias, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants), received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m2 with dosing every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses. During steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QTc interval, in ms (%), were 2(+1%), 14(+4%) and 29(+7%) ms at the 3 dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases above baseline of the QTc interval, in ms (%), were 23(+6%), 36(+9%) and 55(+14%) ms at the 3 dose levels. The steady-state percent increases in the RR interval were 3, 9 and 12%. The smallest children (BSA &amp;lt;0.33m2) showed a tendency for larger Class III effects (ΔQTc) and an increased frequency of prolongations of the QTc interval as compared with the larger children (BSA ≥0.33m2). The beta-blocking effects also tended to be greater in the smaller children (BSA&amp;lt;0.33m2). Both the Class III and beta-blocking effects of sotalol were linearly related with the plasma concentrations.            Hemodynamics: In a study of systemic hemodynamic function measured invasively in 12 patients with a mean LV ejection fraction of 37% and ventricular tachycardia (9 sustained and 3 non-sustained), a median dose of 160 mg twice daily of sotalol produced a 28% reduction in heart rate and a 24% decrease in cardiac index at 2 hours post-dosing at steady-state. Concurrently, systemic vascular resistance and stroke volume showed non-significant increases of 25% and 8%, respectively. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly from 6.4 mmHg to 11.8 mmHg in the 11 patients who completed the study. One patient was discontinued because of worsening congestive heart failure. Mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure and stroke work index did not significantly change. Exercise and isoproterenol induced tachycardia are antagonized by sotalol, and total peripheral resistance increases by a small amount.  In hypertensive patients, sotalol produces significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Although sotalol is usually well-tolerated hemodynamically, in patients with marginal cardiac compensation, deterioration in cardiac performance may occur.             In healthy subjects, the oral bioavailability of sotalol is 90-100%. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 to 4 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2-3 days (i.e., after 5-6 doses when administered twice daily). Over the oral dosage range 160-640 mg/day sotalol displays dose proportionality with respect to plasma concentrations. Distribution occurs to a central (plasma) and to a peripheral compartment, with a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours. Dosing every 12 hours results in trough plasma concentrations which are approximately one-half of those at peak.  Sotalol does not bind to plasma proteins and is not metabolized. Sotalol shows very little intersubject variability in plasma levels. The pharmacokinetics of the d and l enantiomers of sotalol are essentially identical. Sotalol crosses the blood brain barrier poorly. Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].  Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation. The absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to fasting when it was administered with a standard meal. Since sotalol is not subject to first-pass metabolism, patients with hepatic impairment show no alteration in clearance of sotalol.  The combined analysis of two unblinded, multicenter trials (a single dose and a multiple dose study) with 59 children, aged between 3 days and 12 years, showed the pharmacokinetics of sotalol to be first order. A daily dose of 30 mg/m2 of sotalol was administered in the single dose study and daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m2 were administered q8h in the multi-dose study. After rapid absorption with peak levels occurring on average between 2-3 hours following administration, sotalol was eliminated with a mean half-life of 9.5 hours. Steady-state was reached after 1-2 days. The average peak to trough concentration ratio was 2. BSA was the most important covariate and more relevant than age for the pharmacokinetics of sotalol. The smallest children (BSA &amp;lt;0.33 m2) exhibited a greater drug exposure (+59%) than the larger children who showed a uniform drug concentration profile. The intersubject variation for oral clearance was 22%.</Section>

<Sentence id="788" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QTc interval and heart rate.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="789" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="790" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Since the Class III potency in children is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide.</SentenceText>

<SentenceText>From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="792" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m2 three times a day (90 mg/m2 total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total oral daily dose for adults.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="793" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m2 (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="794" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing being carried out in-hospital.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="795" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="796" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For children about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph which shows age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="797" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.97) = 29.1 mg/m2, administered orally three times daily.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="798" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.68) = 20 mg/m2, administered orally three times daily.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="799" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>For a child aged 1 week, the initial starting oral dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 × 0.3) = 9 mg/m2.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="800" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Similar calculations should be made for increased doses as titration proceeds.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="801" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2 years), time to steady-state will also increase.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="802" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>

<SentenceText>In all children, individualization of dosage is required.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="804" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">
<SentenceText>As in adults sotalol should be used with particular caution in children if the QTc is greater than 500 ms on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTc exceeds 550 ms.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="805" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34068-7">

</Sentence>
<Sentence id="916" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Excretion is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form, and therefore lower doses are necessary in conditions of renal impairment.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="917" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>Age per se does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol, but impaired renal function in geriatric patients can increase the terminal elimination half-life, resulting in increased drug accumulation.</SentenceText>
</Sentence>
<Sentence id="918" LabelDrug="Sotalol hydrochloride" section="34090-1">
<SentenceText>The absorption of sotalol was reduced by approximately 20% compared to fasting when it was administered with a standard meal.</SentenceText>
