<Section name="DOSAGE &amp;amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">
For patients with CrCl &amp;gt;30 mL/min: 150 mg orally, twice daily (2.1)  For patients with CrCl 15-30 mL/min: 75 mg orally, twice daily (2.1)  Assess renal function during therapy as clinically indicated and adjust therapy accordingly (2.2)  Instruct patients not to chew, break, or open capsules (2.3)  Review recommendations for converting to or from other oral or parenteral anticoagulants (2.4, 2.5)  Temporarily discontinue PRADAXA before invasive or surgical procedures when possible, then restart promptly (2.6)          For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &amp;gt;30 mL/min, the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 150 mg taken orally, twice daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min), the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 75 mg twice daily  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl &amp;lt;15 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided.          Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with PRADAXA. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue PRADAXA in patients who develop acute renal failure while on PRADAXA and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), concomitant use of the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole can be expected to produce dabigatran exposure similar to that observed in severe renal impairment. Consider reducing the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily  [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Generally, the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed. When necessary, use aPTT or ECT, and not INR, to assess for anticoagulant activity in patients on PRADAXA  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .           Instruct patients to swallow the capsules whole. PRADAXA should be taken with a full glass of water. Breaking, chewing, or emptying the contents of the capsule can result in increased exposure  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  If a dose of PRADAXA is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day; the missed dose should be skipped if it cannot be taken at least 6 hours before the next scheduled dose. The dose of PRADAXA should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.          When converting patients from warfarin therapy to PRADAXA, discontinue warfarin and start PRADAXA when the INR is below 2.0. When converting from PRADAXA to warfarin, adjust the starting time of warfarin based on creatinine clearance as follows:  For CrCl ≥50 mL/min, start warfarin 3 days before discontinuing PRADAXA. For CrCl 30-50 mL/min, start warfarin 2 days before discontinuing PRADAXA. For CrCl 15-30 mL/min, start warfarin 1 day before discontinuing PRADAXA. For CrCl &amp;lt;15 mL/min, no recommendations can be made.  Because PRADAXA can increase INR, the INR will better reflect warfarin’s effect only after PRADAXA has been stopped for at least 2 days  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .          For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start PRADAXA 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of the parenteral drug was to have been administered or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral drug (e.g., intravenous unfractionated heparin). For patients currently taking PRADAXA, wait 12 hours (CrCl ≥30 mL/min) or 24 hours (CrCl &amp;lt;30 mL/min) after the last dose of PRADAXA before initiating treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .          If possible, discontinue PRADAXA 1 to 2 days (CrCl ≥50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl &amp;lt;50 mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .</Section>
<Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">
The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The use of P-gp inhibitors (verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, and clarithromycin) does not require a dose adjustment of PRADAXA. These results should not be extrapolated to other P-gp inhibitors  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The concomitant use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) should be avoided  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Risk of bleeding: PRADAXA can cause serious and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. (5.2)  Bioprosthetic heart valves: PRADAXA use not recommended (5.3)  P-gp inducers and inhibitors: Effects on dabigatran exposure (5.4)            Discontinuing PRADAXA in absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If PRADAXA must be discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].            PRADAXA increases the risk of bleeding andcan cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluateany signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/orhematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue PRADAXA in patients withactive pathological bleeding  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant useof other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-plateletagents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). PRADAXA’s anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patientswith renal impairment  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . A specific reversal agent for dabigatranis not available. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however theclinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatmentfor bleeding is limited [see Overdosage (10)]. Activated prothrombin complex concentrates(aPCCs, e.g., FEIBA), or recombinant Factor VIIa, or concentratesof coagulation factors II, IX or X may be considered but their usehas not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitaminK are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran.Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopeniais present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.           The safety and efficacy of PRADAXA in patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves was evaluated in the RE-ALIGN trial, in which patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves (recently implanted or implanted more than three months prior to enrollment) were randomized to dose adjusted warfarin or 150, 220, or 300 mg of PRADAXA twice a day. RE-ALIGN was terminated early due to the occurrence of significantly more thromboembolic events (valve thrombosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction) and an excess of major bleeding (predominantly post-operative pericardial effusions requiring intervention for hemodynamic compromise) in the PRADAXA treatment arm as compared to the warfarin treatment arm. These bleeding and thromboembolic events were seen both in patients who were initiated on PRADAXA post-operatively within three days of mechanical bileaflet valve implantation, as well as in patients whose valves had been implanted more than three months prior to enrollment. Therefore, the use of PRADAXA is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves [see Contraindications (4)].    The use of PRADAXA for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended.           The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. Consider reducing the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is coadministered with PRADAXA in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min). Avoid use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min)  [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .</Section>
<Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">
Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombin inhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.          At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs the coagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, and TT. INR is relatively insensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpreted the same way as used for warfarin monitoring. The aPTT test provides an approximation of PRADAXA’s anticoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT, following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is shown in Figure 1. The curves represent mean levels without confidence intervals; variations should be expected when measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the level of recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, the curves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular level of recovery, even when the time since the last dose of PRADAXA is not precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10th to 90th percentile) trough aPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.  Figure 1 Average Time Course for Effects of Dabigatran on aPTT, Following Approved PRADAXA Dosing Regimens in Patients with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment*     *Simulations based on PK data from a study in subjects with renal impairment and PK/aPTT relationships derived from the RE-LY study; aPTT prolongation in RE-LY was measured centrally in citrate plasma using PTT Reagent Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany. There may be quantitative differences between various established methods for aPTT assessment. The degree of anticoagulant activity can also be assessed by the ecarin clotting time (ECT). This test is a more specific measure of the effect of dabigatran than activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In the RE-LY trial, the median (10th to 90th percentile) trough ECT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 63 (44 to 103) seconds.           Cardiac Electrophysiology    No prolongation of the QTc interval was observed with dabigatran etexilate at doses up to 600 mg.       Figure 1 Average Time Course for Effects of Dabigatran on aPTT, Following Approved PRADAXA Dosing Regimens in Patients with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment*             Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is absorbed as the dabigatran etexilate ester. The ester is then hydrolyzed, forming dabigatran, the active moiety. Dabigatran is metabolized to four different acyl glucuronides and both the glucuronides and dabigatran have similar pharmacological activity. Pharmacokinetics described here refer to the sum of dabigatran and its glucuronides. Dabigatran displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients in the range of doses from 10 to 400 mg.           Absorption    The absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatran etexilate is approximately 3 to 7%. Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. After oral administration of dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurs at 1 hour post-administration in the fasted state. Coadministration of PRADAXA with a high-fat meal delays the time to Cmax by approximately 2 hours but has no effect on the bioavailability of dabigatran; PRADAXA may be administered with or without food. The oral bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate increases by 75% when the pellets are taken without the capsule shell compared to the intact capsule formulation. PRADAXA capsules should therefore not be broken, chewed, or opened before administration.             Distribution    Dabigatran is approximately 35% bound to human plasma proteins. The red blood cell to plasma partitioning of dabigatran measured as total radioactivity is less than 0.3. The volume of distribution of dabigatran is 50 to 70 L. Dabigatran pharmacokinetics are dose proportional after single doses of 10 to 400 mg. Given twice daily, dabigatran’s accumulation factor is approximately two.             Elimination    Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the urine. Renal clearance of dabigatran is 80% of total clearance after intravenous administration. After oral administration of radiolabeled dabigatran, 7% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and 86% in feces. The half-life of dabigatran in healthy subjects is 12 to 17 hours.             Metabolism    After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is converted to dabigatran. The cleavage of the dabigatran etexilate by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to the active principal dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. Dabigatran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acyl glucuronides. Four positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, and 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, and each accounts for less than 10% of total dabigatran in plasma.             Renal Impairment    An open, parallel-group single-center study compared dabigatran pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment receiving a single dose of PRADAXA 150 mg. Exposure to dabigatran increases with severity of renal function impairment (Table 3). Similar findings were observed in the RE-LY trial.  Table 3 Impact of Renal Impairment on Dabigatran Pharmacokinetics           +Patients with severe renal impairment were not studied in RE-LY. Dosing recommendations in subjects with severe renal impairment are based on pharmacokinetic modeling  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .       Renal Function     CrCl (mL/min)     Increase in AUC     Increase in Cmax      t1/2 (h)       Normal   ≥ 80 1x 1x 13     Mild   50-80 1.5x 1.1x 15     Moderate   30-50 3.2x 1.7x 18     Severe+    15-30 6.3x 2.1x 27                 Hepatic Impairment    Administration of PRADAXA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed a large inter-subject variability, but no evidence of a consistent change in exposure or pharmacodynamics.             Drug Interactions      Impact of Other Drugs on Dabigatran             P-gp Inducers    Rifampin: Rifampin 600 mg once daily for 7 days followed by a single dose of dabigatran decreased its AUC and Cmax by 66% and 67%, respectively. By Day 7 after cessation of rifampin treatment, dabigatran exposure was close to normal  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7)] .           P-gp Inhibitors  In studies with the P-gp inhibitors ketoconazole, amiodarone, verapamil, and quinidine, the time to peak, terminal half-life, and mean residence time of dabigatran were not affected. Any observed changes in Cmax and AUC are described below.   Dronedarone : Simultaneous administration of dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone (administered once or twice daily) increases exposure to dabigatran by 70 to 140% compared to dabigatran alone. The increase in exposure is only 30 to 60% higher compared to dabigatran alone when dronedarone is administered 2 hours after dabigatran etexilate.   Ketoconazole : Systemic ketoconazole increased dabigatran AUC and Cmax values by 138% and 135%, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg, and 153%, and 149%, respectively, after multiple daily doses of 400 mg.   Verapamil : When dabigatran etexilate was coadministered with oral verapamil, the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased. The extent of increase depends on the formulation of verapamil and timing of administration. If verapamil is present in the gut when dabigatran is taken, it will increase exposure to dabigatran with the greatest increase observed when a single dose of immediate-release verapamil is given one hour prior to dabigatran (AUC increased by a factor of 2.4). If verapamil is given 2 hours after dabigatran, the increase in AUC is negligible. In the population pharmacokinetics study from RE-LY, no important changes in dabigatran trough levels were observed in patients who received verapamil.   Amiodarone : When dabigatran etexilate was coadministered with a single 600 mg oral dose of amiodarone, the dabigatran AUC and Cmax increased by 58% and 50%, respectively. The increase in exposure was mitigated by a 65% increase in the renal clearance of dabigatran in the presence of amiodarone. The increase in renal clearance may persist after amiodarone is discontinued because of amiodarone’s long half-life. In the population pharmacokinetics study from RE-LY, no important changes in dabigatran trough levels were observed in patients who received amiodarone.   Quinidine : Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2 hours up to a total dose of 1000 mg. Dabigatran etexilate was given over 3 consecutive days, the last evening dose on Day 3 with or without quinidine pre-dosing. Concomitant quinidine administration increased dabigatran’s AUC and Cmax by 53% and 56%, respectively.   Clarithromycin: Coadministered clarithromycin had no impact on the exposure to dabigatran.           Other Drugs    Clopidogrel: When dabigatran etexilate was given concomitantly with a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, the dabigatran AUC and Cmax increased by approximately 30% and 40%, respectively. The concomitant administration of dabigatran etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. When comparing combined treatment and the respective mono-treatments, the coagulation measures for dabigatran’s effect (aPTT, ECT, and TT) remained unchanged, and inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA), a measurement of clopidogrel’s effect, remained unchanged.   Enoxaparin: Enoxaparin 40 mg given subcutaneously for 3 days with the last dose given 24 hours before a single dose of PRADAXA had no impact on the exposure to dabigatran or the coagulation measures aPTT, ECT, or TT.   Diclofenac, Ranitidine, and Digoxin: None of these drugs alters exposure to dabigatran. In RE-LY, dabigatran plasma samples were also collected. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists, and digoxin did not appreciably change the trough concentration of dabigatran.          Impact of Dabigatran on Other Drugs   In clinical studies exploring CYP3A4, CYP2C9, P-gp and other pathways, dabigatran did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, atorvastatin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, clopidogrel, digoxin, pantoprazole, or ranitidine.</Section>
